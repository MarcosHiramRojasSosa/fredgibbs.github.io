Review of _Chymists and Chymistry: Studies in the History of Alchemy and Early Modern Chemistry_. Lawrence M. Principe, ed. (Chemical Heritage Foundation and Science History Publications, 2007). 

This volume comprises twenty-two papers presented at an international conference on the history of alchemy and early chemistry, for which the principle goals were to tie alchemy into other disciplines, to illustrate the exciting research underway, and to outline the fruitful avenues of research awaiting exploration. The assembled conference papers succeed convincingly in these goals. Through close readings of both well-known and neglected texts, the contributors bring to light the diversity of practitioners of early chemistry, their social and intellectual engagements with each other, and their conflicting understandings of the natural world. A few informal themes emerged from the collection: consideration of how texts were used in view of their highly symbolic language, discussions of matter theory and its implications, and explorations of socio-political contexts.

Several authors focus on the connotations and usage of alchemical texts. Peter Forshaw points out interpretive differences between two translations (c. 1600) of the Emerald Tablet by Libavius and Khunrath, highlighting the degree of semantic fluidity in alchemical writing. Libavius’ plea for literal as opposed to allegorical translations is marshaled by Stephen Clucas to argue against the historiographical convention that ‘growing discontent’ among later alchemical practitioners can account for alchemy’s decline. Gabriele Ferrario analyzes Arabic and Hebrew versions of a medieval alchemical manuscript to show that the nature of such texts was more akin to working documents ready to accommodate new recipes and laboratory notes than to fixed texts.

Representation and language in alchemical writing is nothing if not rich, and several analyses help unpack the imagery: Bruce Moran describes how Libavius understood the cognitive structures of metaphors and their link to occult virtues; Allison Kavey makes inroads into understanding the meanings of gender references in alchemical texts. On the visual side, Barbara Obrist examines a depiction of Nature from an early sixteenth-century miniature to demonstrate how such visual imagery reflects the disciplinary divide between natural philosophical inquiry and mechanical arts, especially alchemy.

As the symbolism of alchemical texts often refers to the materials or processes of nature, several contributors focus their effort on debates regarding matter theory. Victor Boantza explores the epistemology of the sixteenth-century Parisian chemist Samuel Duclos as to his ideas of particles and spirits; Luc Peterschmitt examines the positions of three seventeenth-century Cartesians and the various extents to which they subscribe to the notion of a mechanical foundation of chemistry. In a similar vein, Bernard Joly looks at early eighteenth-century disagreements between Lémery and Geoffroy with respect to the artificial production of iron and the mechanics of alchemy. In terms of new texts, Kevin Chang examines a largely neglected text of Stahl to demonstrate his declining allegiance to Becher and the implications for vitalism; William Newman sheds new light a text by Newton on metallic generation, arguing that it may link Newton’s theory of mineral composition with his experimental practice. Marcos Martinón-Torres reminds us that the study of alchemical theory ought to be balanced by a complementary study of its physical aspects as revealed by archeology. He and R. Werner Soukup focus on the all-important crucible, using their findings to learn about actual alchemical laboratory practice and early modern trade of laboratory equipment. 
The interplay between certain religious and alchemical beliefs, especially as regards matter theory and spontaneous generation, form the crux of several revealing articles. Dane Daniel explores the links between Paracelsian medicine and radical Christianity; Margaret Garber describes some Jesuit reservations at the University of Prague about theories of generation in relation to the Eucharist, and situates them in the broader disciplinary debate of who could make claims regarding the material foundations of living things. Hiro Hirai attends to the juxtaposition of alchemy and religion in Kircher’s views on spontaneous generation and the particular influences upon him.

To complement the study of literal and figurative textual meanings, several articles foreground the myriad social and political networks in which alchemists played a part. The diverse paths of learning, for example, are exposed by Wouter Hanegraaff’s description of the how Giovanni de Correggio acquired his alchemical knowledge. For the governing conditions of alchemical practice, patronage, of course, loomed large. Along these lines, Tara Nummedal evaluates the discourse on alchemical fraud with an emphasis on the contractual conditions that allowed for fraud claims. Her example of Nuschler’s unfortunate saga provides a counterpoint to Didier Kahn’s description of the disinterested alchemical patronage of Henry IV. The last few papers follow the social contours of chymistry into the Enlightenment. John Powers demonstrates the blurring of alchemy and chemistry in Boerhaave’s work, especially in relation to his professorship of chemistry and the experiments of his contemporaries; Hjalmar Fors examines the significant role of the Sweedish Board of Mines as an early venue for chemistry and knowledge production around the turn of the eighteenth century; Claus Priesner provides a complementary look at the role of secret societies like the Gold- and Rose-Cross at the end of the century, in particular their interest in alchemy and its mystical elements in the face the emergence of ‘modern’ esoteric alchemy.

Such short papers can only scratch the surface of much deeper and richer research agendas. But there is no shortage of intellectual fervor here, and the articles effortlessly canvas a wide array of topics with a high degree of interconnectedness. Several recurring topics, such as the blurring of disciplinary boundaries (often between alchemy, chemistry, and physics), and the variegated influence of Paracelsian thinking on (al)chymical practitioners, unify the articles considerably more than is typical for a volume of conference papers. The significance of the research is revealed by the efforts of many articles to modify or refute entrenched historiographical traditions. While some specific case studies could have benefited from greater contextualization, the overall collection strikes a welcome balance between breadth and specificity.
