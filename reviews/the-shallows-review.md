Review of Nicholas Carr, _The Shallows. What the Internet is Doing to Our Brains_. Norton, 2010.

Always on the lookout for relevant readings that might be useful for my digital history course, I finally got around to reading Nicholas Carr's _The Shallows_. I have assigned his provocative 2008 _Atlantic_ article “[Is Google Making Us Stupid](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/6868/)” to good effect, where he questions whether we’re losing our ability for deep thinking and sustained concentration because we flit around from webpage to webpage, hyperlink to hyperlink, becoming the robotic humans of _2001: A Space Odyssey_ (in contrast to the seemingly emotional but monotone Hal). I thought that the book version might provide a deeper critique of how people are changing how they process information and what that might mean for academics and their work&#8211;and thus help motivate course topics about history and new media. To that end, I thought I would post my thoughts about the Carr's book in case anyone else had similar inclinations.

From the article, Carr's interesting questions and engaging writing sets high expectations for the book. Unfortunately (at least for my purposes), rather than elaborating on the nature of and larger cultural implications of shallow thinking, Carr endeavors to prove the tenet of his article: that our brains are rewiring themselves to deal with our media environments. As a result, we can't concentrate like we used to. He ultimately focuses too much on the scientific proof of the immediate adaptability of our brain rather than exploring the cultural implications (and legacy, considering this isn't exactly new criticism) of how new media perhaps does challenge traditional thought patterns.

Carr’s goal for the early chapters is to put into plain language some of Marshall McLuhan’s ideas about the effects of media on our consciousness. Carr does this pretty well, and then attempts to combine these sentiments with some recent studies on cognition and memory. But it's here where he spends far too much time explaining, in excruciating biological detail, how our brains re-wire themselves when faced with new stimuli. Consequently, as our brains adapt to our supersaturated media environment, we lose the ability to engage in movement from working to long-term memory. It's during this process where our brains can make important creative connections and do other important thinking in the humanities. But without this process, our thinking is becoming, literally and figuratively, too shallow.  

I'm not convinced that the studies Carr references shows what he wants them to show. For example, Carr cites numerous studies that demonstrate that people who watch a newscast remember less of it when there is other information appearing on the screen. This is presented as evidence for shallow learning as a result of being distracted. But perhaps the people subjected to more information learned more and connected more data points even if the main message was learned less well. In this example and others, Carr makes a case for a lack of depth without seeing how the test doesn’t recognize wider learning that, in theory, could provide the stimulation of creativity and meaning that he argues is being sabotaged by the way we use the Internet. Of course these studies are not unchallenged: [Jonah Lehrer's review](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/06/books/review/Lehrer-t.html) of Carr's book points to other contradictory studies (which led to a [interesting discussion](http://scienceblogs.com/cortex/2010/06/the_shallows.php) between the two of them); Steven Pinker and others have argued against the brain's biological imperative to adapt almost instantaneously. Lehrer says that Carr is most successful with his cultural criticism, but I don't quite see it. Because Carr never really engages with prior technological naysayers, nor applies any of their ideas to the present day, his cultural criticism comes off more as the neighbor's annoying yappy dog than the elephant in the room.

In trying to see past the biological trees for the cultural forest, I wonder if the deep/shallow dichotomy really exists or is helpful. Or if it was emphasized to make the studies on multitasking seem more clear-cut than they really are. Carr's claim is that by not engaging with books with longer arguments and sentences, we're unable to really appreciate them. But what is the constraining factor about online environments that force shallow connections? Are we not simply temporarily smitten with the novelty of the hyperlink (at least in practice if not theory)? The dichotomy is most unfortunate because, in Carr's analysis, it's an either/or proposition. We can't have shallower but broader thinking. Or if we can, it's not as good as what we had before. But where does the value judgment between shallow and deep come from? Doesn't volume matter? Aren't we simply taught to value &#8220;deep&#8221; thinking out of tradition rather than innate superiority? Nature wins over nurture in Carr's analysis. There is nothing about educational priorities or media literacy in the book, which seems an unfortunate omission given the negative judgments and grave concerns he has about how new media is shaping our thinking.

The book (and, more understandably, the article) suffers throughout from monolithic characterizations. This is one area where I thought the book might add nuance and weight to the article. However, Carr's ongoing discussion of &#8220;the book&#8221; circumscribes itself to generalizations that cannot help but to weaken any force of his argument. Similarly, Carr problematically equates single-tasking with reading and multi-tasking with websites. I was disappointed that he does not grapple with the extent to which web design (still in its adolescence if not infancy) could make for rather different user experiences than we have now. Nor does he consider the many tools that help the more easily distracted of us readers and writers block everything else off our screens (i.e. people have already recognized and started to solve the problem Carr points out). For Carr, books are good. What kind of books? The great classics of literature, of course. But it’s not clear that the internet or any media has substantially decreased consumption of these kinds of books or what we get out of them. But for Carr, if we weren’t mindlessly following scripts on the web we’d be deepening our humanity by reading Keats. 

Given it's content, I wasn't surprised after reading the book to learn that it's categorized/labeled as &#8220;science.&#8221; Yet it seems that the reason Carr wrote the book was not give us a science lesson, but to underscore the importance of humanistic thinking. Yet he remains silent on exactly what this importance is&#8211;that is, why we should care about the scientific studies he cites. This made me wonder about his intended audience, which proved an elusive concept. On one hand, he labors over technical biology terminology; on the other hand, he addresses an audience for whom reading is difficult: “&#8230;I appreciate your fortitude in staying with me.” Throughout the book, Carr mixes urgency (&#8220;The electronic revolution is approaching culmination&#8230;&#8221;) (?!) with a healthy dose of doom (“We are welcoming the frenziedness into our souls&#8230;” and “&#8230;we’ve numbed an essential part of ourself”). There is hardly lip service to the fact that we're in the relatively infancy of web technology, where growing pains in both production and use are inevitable. 

From a media studies standpoint, Carr doesn’t offer anything beyond the notion that the &#8220;medium is the massage&#8221;, though the cited studies give some grounding to the older theories (though they needed about as much proof as the theory of gravity). From an intellectual history standpoint, Carr samples far too lightly to take seriously. From a cultural criticism standpoint, it's derivative and vapid. Carr neither outlines any larger implications of his claims that we’re flattening our intelligence into singular artificial intelligence, nor shows any evidence for a decline of culture and creativity. Nor does he show that any similar decline happened after transformations brought by printing, radio, and television as critics predicted would happen in the same way Carr claims is true for the Internet. But that's the book I was hoping for, not necessarily what Carr wanted to do. But these omissions make Carr’s book another hollow reverberation in the echo chamber of resistance to technological change.
