        Greetings! I'm an assitant professor of history in the land of enchantment at the Univeristy of New Mexico. 
      <p>
        Most of my <a href="projects">current projects</a> attempt (1) to use new digital research methodologies to provide new historical perspectives through unusual combinations of historical data at scale, and (2) to use new media technologies to make history more engaging and accessible to a broad public.
      <p>
      In academic terms, I study the confluence of medicine and natural philosophy in the medieval and early modern periods. I'm also interested in the circulation and diffusion of medical knowledge in the late Middle Ages.
      <p>
        My <a href="medieval-and-early-modern-toxicology">poison manuscript</a> presents a new history of premodern toxicology based on how physicians discussed the nature of poison in medical literature from 1200-1600, especially its relationship to medicine, plague, contagion, disease.
      <p>
        Here I <a href="posts">post essays</a> about various issues confronting the so-called digital humanities. Sometimes I <a href="publications">publish</a> things elsewhere. 
      <p>
        At UNM, I teach <a href="courses">courses</a> in the digital humanities and on various topics in the history of medicine and science.
      <p>
