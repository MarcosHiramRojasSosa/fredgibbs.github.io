# PROJECT PORTFOLIO

## "Poison, Medicine, and Disease in Late Medieval and Early Modern Europe"
This manuscript (reviewed and accepted for publication at Routledge; currently under copyediting) explores late medieval and early modern medical debates about the nature of poison (_venenum_). Drawing from an unusually wide range of medical and natural philosophical texts&#8211;especially treatises on poison, pharmacy, pharmacology, plague, and the nature of disease&#8211;this book explores a neglected but enlightening ontological debate about the existence of a category of substance fundamentally harmful to the human body (that is, poison) and the corresponding implications for medical theory and practice.


## "Digital + Scholarship: Towards New Review Criteria and Practices"
This manuscript-in-progress formulates a basis for how to evaluate new processes and forms of humanities scholarship. In considering the changing forms and goals of scholarship and scholarly service, it takes the much-needed step of outlining rigorous definitions, fundamental values, and evaluative criteria of humanities scholarship in the digital age, and how they might best fulfill the goals of the humanities in the twenty-first century.


## Spatial Humanities Working Group
The [Spatial Humanities Working Group](http://spatialhumanities.unm.edu) aims to build connections across disciplinary boundaries by providing an informal setting in which students and faculty across the university can meet to discuss theoretical, conceptual, and methodological questions regarding space and human societies.


## _Programming Historian_
[_Programming Historian_](http://programminghistorian.org) offers novice-friendly, peer-reviewed tutorials that help humanists learn a wide range of digital tools, techniques, and workflows to facilitate their research. As a general editor since 2012, I have carefully edited and sheparded over a half-dozen lessons through the publication process. More importantly, I have focused my efforts on developing and documenting a transparent and sustainable editorial process anchored with free, open source tools and a committment to open access.


## _Histories of the Future_ 
This project was an experiment to see if a small academic workshop (on speculative futures in the history of science) could produce and make available a collection of scholarly work in an open access web format that would remain more visible an active than the results (and papers) from a typical academic workshop. Our work lives on at [histscifi.com](http://histscifi.com).



# PAUSED OR COMPLETED PROJECTS

## New Interfaces to Medieval Manuscripts
Efforts to connect manuscript catalogs face numerable technical challenges, which make it easy to consider the access to and visualization of manuscript metadata as secondary to creating the technical infrastructure itself. Consequently, even with advanced search features of digital catalogs, we end up using manuscript catalogs mostly in the same ways we have in printed books, missing out on new opportunities to connect and study medieval manuscripts at much larger scales.

## Metadata Improvement VIA Mapping (MIVIAM)
This project developed a prototype (initially funded by the Mellon Foundation) to ease the process of mapping historical data and clean up (inevitably) messy data in the process. MIVIAM's rich user interface allows users to map specific sets of data---about which they have expertise---and thus can easily recognize and correct problems with metadata, thus improving their own maps and making the data more useful for everyone else at the same time. 

## Reframing the Victorians
With funding from one of the twelve [Google Digital Humanities Grants](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/07/our-commitment-to-digital-humanities.html), Dan Cohen and I explored the massive corpus of Victorian literature held at Google Books in order to reevaluate and complicate the stereotypical characterizations of the Victorians based on anecdotal sampling of the traditional literary canon. 

## Digging Into Data: Criminal Intent
The [Criminal Intent](http://criminalintent.org) project demonstrates the potential roles for text mining in historical practice, showing that greater historical rigor can be achieved, and new insights gained, by moving from a single trial or narrow run of relevant examples to an analysis of statistically significant textual patterns found in [Proceedings of the Old Bailey](http://oldbaileyonline.org), Londonâ€™s central criminal court over a period of 240 years, as a single, massive whole. In addition to the Old Bailey Proceedings, our work builds on the successes of [Zotero](http://zotero.org) virtual collections, [TAPoR](http://portal.tapor.ca/portal/portal) and [Voyeur analytics](voyeurtools.org).

## ScholarPress
Most online education tools remain far too closed, proprietary, and complex for most of the essential tasks that scholars need to do on a daily basis. Scholarpress created a suite of focused plug-ins for the ubiquitous blogging platform WordPress to help humanities teachers and researchers create syllabi, course websites, and display bibliographies.
