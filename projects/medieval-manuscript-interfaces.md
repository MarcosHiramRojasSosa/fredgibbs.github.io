# New Interfaces to Medieval Manuscripts
Any effort to connect manuscript catalogs faces numerable technical challenges that make it easy to get bogged down in capturing and connecting basic information about manuscripts. Such difficulties make it easy to consider the access to and visualization of manuscript metadata as secondary to creating the technical infrastructure itself. Consequently, even with advanced search features of digital catalogs, we end up using manuscript catalogs mostly in the same ways we have in printed books, missing out on new opportunities to connect and study medieval manuscripts at much larger scales.

I've begun work on a prototype project that will create a digital medieval archive with new possibilities to re-conceptualize the kinds of data we maintain, how we interact with it, and how we can create a much richer archive in the process. In particular, it pursues three principal goals: 

(1) An archive driven by linked open data will not only enable new research methodologies, but also will present new opportunities for exploration and discovery of manuscripts and their contents. But we must think carefully about how traditional interactions with bibliographic data may inadvertently limit possible research questions. In creating a new kind of manuscript archive, we must consider how metadata (and its inherent uncertainty) might be represented on maps, in network diagrams, and in other configurations that will require or benefit from metadata fields that have not traditionally been a part of manuscript catalog data. 

(2) Creative metadata visualization can help leverage scholarly expertise to continually correct and contribute to manuscript metadata, and therefore must be considered early on in the design process. Data deficiencies can thus be seen at a glance during the course of research, and help to distribute the work of simple error correction and the process of standardization across the community of experts rather than a few  (perhaps less expert) gatekeepers. 

(3) Visual catalog displays can make the process of metadata determination a much more open and transparent process. As the typical disciplinary distinctions between archivists, librarians, and research scholars become increasingly blurred, we must use digital catalogs that cross institutional and disciplinary boundaries to allow scholars to improve manuscript catalogs. This cannot be done anonymously but in a carefully controlled way we must augment typical metadata with historiographic metadata. The site of knowledge production must be much more open to specialists that can bring their expertise to improving data about manuscripts.
