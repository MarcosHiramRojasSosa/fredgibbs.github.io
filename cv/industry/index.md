## Professional Interests
As a historian of premodern medicine, with research interests ranging from medieval and early modern toxicology (on which I have a monograph forthcoming from Routledge) to twentieth-century conceptions of nutrition, I am intimately familiar with an unusually wide range of medical history sources, bibliographies, and library cataloging and metadata standards. As a pioneering digital humanities scholar, my various research projects and collaborations have experimented with and theorized about new ways historians should be able to access, analyze, and communicate about the historical record. The Supervisory Librarian position focusing on rare books and early manuscripts will not only leverage my wide-ranging medical history expertise and technical skills in information architecture, but also allow me to bring together historical research in premodern medicine and digital humanities, facilitating new kinds of research projects and increasing the visibility of medical history resources at NLM.

* 10+ years experience assembling and managing bibliographies of premoden medical books and manuscripts
* Intimate familiarity with manuscript, inculabula, and early modern book cataloging standards and protocols

* Successful grant-writer with various national organizations including National Science Foundation, National Endowment for the Humanities, Google, and Mellon Foundation
* Peer-reviewed author of one book (forthcoming) and a dozen scholarly articles for broad and specialized audiences related to history of medicine and digital history
* 10+ years experience of classroom teaching (both lecture and discussion format) in higher education


## Technical Skills and Experience
* Web development with Javascript, HTML5, CSS, PHP, AJAX, REST APIs, XML, XSLT, Bootstrap, Django

## Recent Academic Research Projects

### Poison, Medicine, and Disease in Medieval and Early Modern Europe
This manuscript (accepted for publication at Routledge) explores late medieval and early modern medical debates about the nature of poison (_venenum_). Drawing from an extraordinarily wide range of medical and natural philosophical texts---especially treatises on poison, pharmacy, pharmacology, plague, and the nature of disease–--this book explores a neglected but enlightening ontological debate about the existence of a category of substance fundamentally harmful to the human body and its implications for understanding the nature of disease.

### Spatial Humanities Working Group (Aug2015 - present)
Different disciplines think about space in very different ways, ranging across the history of cartography, contested borderlands, remote sensing research, and the metaphoric use of space in literary prose. The introduction of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) – a technology designed for positivist lines of inquiry – to humanities research has further engendered new research questions and debates. In light of the increased attention to space – geographical or otherwise – within the humanities, this working group aims to build connections across disciplinary boundaries by providing an informal setting in which students and faculty across the university can meet to discuss theoretical, conceptual, and methodological questions regarding space and human societies. See more at the [SHWG website](spatialhumanities.unm.edu).

### General Editor, _Programming Historian_ (Apr2012 - present)
_[Programming Historian](http://programminghistorian.org)_ offers novice-friendly, peer-reviewed tutorials that help humanists learn a wide range of digital tools, techniques, and workflows to facilitate their research. I have been a general editor since 2012; I have guided over a half-dozen lessons from proposals to polished tutorials. More importantly, I have focused my efforts on community building and developing a transparent and sustainable editorial process—anchored with free, open source tools and volunteer labor—that best facilitates the creation of peer-reviewed, high quality academic resources that are and will remain entirely free and open access. Our work provides a model for academic publishing that avoids the bloated costs and inaccessibility of most academic resources. [My description of our editorial values and process](http://dhcommons.org/journal/issue-1/editorial-sustainability-and-open-peer-review-programming-historian) was recently published in the inaugural issue of [DHCommons](http://dhcommons.org/).
