## Ongoing Digital Projects 

### SPATIAL HUMANITIES WORKING GROUP (AUG2015 - PRESENT)
Different disciplines think about space in very different ways, ranging across the history of cartography, contested borderlands, remote sensing research, and the metaphoric use of space in literary prose. The introduction of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) – a technology designed for positivist lines of inquiry – to humanities research has further engendered new research questions and debates. In light of the increased attention to space – geographical or otherwise – within the humanities, this working group aims to build connections across disciplinary boundaries by providing an informal setting in which students and faculty across the university can meet to discuss theoretical, conceptual, and methodological questions regarding space and human societies. See more at the SHWG website.

### GENERAL EDITOR, PROGRAMMING HISTORIAN (APR2012 - PRESENT)
Programming Historian offers novice-friendly, peer-reviewed tutorials that help humanists learn a wide range of digital tools, techniques, and workflows to facilitate their research. I have been a general editor since 2012; I have guided over a half-dozen lessons from proposals to polished tutorials. More importantly, I have focused my efforts on community building and developing a transparent and sustainable editorial process—anchored with free, open source tools and volunteer labor—that best facilitates the creation of peer-reviewed, high quality academic resources that are and will remain entirely free and open access. Our work provides a model for academic publishing that avoids the bloated costs and inaccessibility of most academic resources. 

## Previous Digital Humanities Projects

### Metadata Improvement VIA Mapping (MIVIAM) (Dec10-Jan12)
* Designed and coded robust Javascript interface to visualize thousands of data points via the Google Maps API (using plant specimen data held at [JSTOR Plants](http://plants.jstor.org))
* Created sorting, filtering, and editing functions allowed researchers to correct and normalize metadata for easier research on botanical expeditions
* Architected database schema and interface to manage suggested changes to metadata

### Reframing the Victorians (Sep10-Sep11)
* Created various visualizations of ~1.5M 19th-century books from Google Books
* Developed and coordinated large data mining operation using Amazon S3 and Elastic MapReduce
* Published pioneering digital history methodology piece in _Victorian Studies_

### Digging Into Data: Criminal Intent (Sep09 - Sep10)
* Developed Zotero translator to harvest data from the Old Bailey API
* Researched cases on poison using Old Bailey Online API and Voyant
* Participated in routine conference calls with project team to review progress and meet deadlines
