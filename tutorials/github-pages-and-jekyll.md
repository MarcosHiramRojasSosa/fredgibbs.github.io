- Save your changes with the Commit button
- Create and save the main.css file, too.
- Go to "Settings tab, and scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section
- Select master branch. Find the link for your website at the top of that section. It should look like `USERNAME.github.io/hello-world`
- If you get 404 error, just wait a few minutes.
- Youâ€™ve created a website! :tada:
