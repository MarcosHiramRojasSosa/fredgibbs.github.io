Getting started with making your own maps can be intimidating. One of the main problems: Although there are many code snippets and tutorials online, these are not meant to be starting points for people relatively new to programming, but rather to illustrate some particular syntax or concept. These are great if you already know a fair amount about how to make maps already.

To complement a summer 2014 course on [digital mapping](/courses/digital-mapping), I've put together a few maps that are meant to show complete examples of how to enact basic and sometimes intermediate mapping functionality. Several of the examples are similar, but things in slightly different ways, just for variety's sake. Hopefully by investigating them as a whole, the invidiual pieces will make more sense.
