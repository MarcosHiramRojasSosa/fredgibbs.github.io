Isn't it silly to expect people to pay $600 for a scarf? Fashion designer Tomas Maier replies that we should all just have less. As reported in one of my favorite New Yorker articles, Maier explains his philosophy of having few but nice things that can be replaced when needed. I recently found this logic especially attractive when packing a house full of too much stuff I just have to have.

This militant but elegant minimalism permeated my thinking about my website as a new job and new city seemed to require a corresponding website renaissance. It made me get very clear about exactly what was I trying to do with my website. Ultimately, it's to provide information about what I'm thinking about and working on and teaching in the clearest and simplest way. 

How can I be most clear? For starters, strip away absolutely everything that isn't absolutely essential: sidebars, categories, antiquated punctuation for print publications; extraneous typefaces and design elements I began to wonder how necessary the traditional blog/CMS trappings really were. Do I need an extensive list of post categories? An automated navigation bar? An administrative panel?  _How much less could I have?_

Not only did I want the simplest experience for visitors, but also for my writing process. To be sure, I've loved Wordpress as a website (not just blogging) engine for many years. Almost whenever I want to do something, that's not built in, there's a plug-in. If not, it's easy enough to hack something together, which usually lasts as long as it needs to. 

Yet I never was entirely comfortable that my "official" document was an entry in a database table rather than a document that could be managed separately. I wanted my website not just a virtual hangout for my self-publications, but i place where I can continue to improve work started some time ago that hasn't quite reached its potential. Embrace the potential ongoing scholarship. But I also see the value in maintaining the space/time continuum, as people need to know what version people may have read at a particular time. I thought it would be nice if I had an easier way to create and manage versions of posts. This is not to say that Wordpress cannot manage versions of static files, but that there are far more efficient ways to do that. Github adds a layer of complexity but also a freedom to revise without worry of blowing out the flux capacitors.
 
Thus I decided to experiment with using Jekyll to create a static website from markdown and textile files. 
My initial reservation was that one limitation of any kind of markdown technology is that it is so incredibly text-centric. For what i've written it would work fine, and would be an improvement over wordpress bloat. BUT, it is also fundamentally at odds with my desire to have a more deliberately designed article/blog/page. I worried about losing the possibility of highly-stylized and interactive pages. But unless you fetishize language purity, it's easy to mix HTML into markdown or textile files.

Thus the current website has been rebirthed. Posts have been revised. I have resisted temptation to save everything, because not everything should be saved. Earlier filler posts have vanished (Don't worry, I kept plenty of junk).
