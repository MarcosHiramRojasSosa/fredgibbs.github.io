The idea of using GitHub pages proved an interesting way of thinking about managing different semesters' syllabi. There have been discussions about forking syllabi (owens, croxall) for the purposes of giving credit. But the fork is not necessary to give credit, and given the highly personal and holistic nature of a syllabus, that was not a concern for me. But I was intrigued by idea of version controlling my syllabus. they change from semester to semester. 

Having to commit changes to my syllabus made me think about the syllabus like code. What changes was I making? Were they discrete improvements? How would i describe them? It made the act of syllabus revision less like tinkering, and more like deliberate and efficient problem solving. This would not be very efficient for initial creation, at least for me, since I tend to feverishly jot down ideas and rearrange them. But once there is a semi-stable version, github provided an almost ideal way of keeping track of what I'm doing.
