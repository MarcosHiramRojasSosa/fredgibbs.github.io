We've all been back from Kalamazoo long enough to forget about the mini-safaris between sessions and fear of awkward sharted dorm bathroom encounters. 

By now we think predominately of the many interesting papers we heard and the camaraderie of being around 3070 other people who share an interest with discovering and arguing about stuff that happened a thousand years ago in a world, whose complexity and richness that we can scarcely even conceive as derived from the comparatively meager historical record. Indeed, it's easy to romanticize the magic of the zoo. I like to.

It is also clear that one fundamental tradition flaw haunts the Congree as it ages well into the second decade of the 21st century: the ubiquitous habit of simply reading papers to a passive audience.

Obviously this not a feature/flaw unique to Kalamazoo. But as engaging as paper presentations may be (and I've certainly seen my share of excellent ones), they largely defeat the point of the entire conference---arguably the aspect that repeatedly brings people back: the conversations we have with each other about the papers. We could take much better advantage of the variety of perspectives and expertise that end up in virtually all of the several dozen concurrent sessions. But at least 2/3 of each session (at least; often more) is dedicated to *NOT TALKING*. 

Arguably, it's interstitial hallway chats and coffee breaks and happy hours where all the interesting work happens at any conference. But this is especially true at the Zoo where the so many different specialties gather to cross pollinate their own ideas. I assume I'm not alone in thinking that some of the most interesting papers are ones that tangentially overlap with one's own research--not too much or it won't be useful, but not so little that you're lost. 

I don't mean to minimize the performative aspect of giving papers to an audience. But I would argue that at least from my limited experience, not many people acutally *perform* a paper rather than simply read it.

Of course people give papers for many reasons, and important one is the formal participation in a scholarly community. But the Zoo is less of a professional development conference in the formal sense, as there are often more focused, selective conferences that are more effective CV builders, if one feels compelled to do that. The Zoo is about the people. And this makes it often a more useful conference than ones that are more geared toward professional advancement.

This essay is an open plea for session organizers to insist that papers be made available before the acutal session so that the author gives a 5 minute review of the paper in the session and the rest of the time is dedicated to discussion. In an experimental form, perhaps the session organizer can insist on a deadline a week or so ahead of the panel date, and then make papers available online with a link that can be visible on the conference program. Anyone looking over the program can visit the link, check out the papers ahead of time, and determine if they want to show up and talk about them. This is obviously a bit of extra work, but it is not a significant technical challenge.

One may object, I suppose, that people would read the papers instead of showing up to the sessions. We all know there is too much stuff happening at one time. This almost certainly will happen. But the papers can give a sense of what the conversation will be about. Let's be honest: there is a *wide* variety of paper quality at the Zoo, whether by graduate students, early career scholars, or the most well established and accomplished professors.  But since when don't academics want to talk about something that's interesting to them? I would argue that the papers will be ignored will be the ones that aren't found particularly interesting in the first place.

One may object to this practice that a work in progress thus becomes prematurely "published." But have we not learned to differentiate between work we can access and work that is published? In any case, the paper is available only for a short time. And if someone can read a paper and turn out a better article

I suspect that the sessions where people have a chance to think about the issues ahead of time and formulate questions, comments, and criticisms, will prove far more useful to both the session attendees and the paper authors. I hope this will also encourage more collaborative work as well.
