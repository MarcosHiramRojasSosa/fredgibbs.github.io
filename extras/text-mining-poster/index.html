	<p>
	You've certainly heard how text mining can reveal hidden patterns, new research questions, and either confirm or counter intuition. 
	Yet it is often discussed in technical and intimidating terms. 
	</p>
	<p class="highlight">
	While it may be mathematically sophisticated, text mining can also be done in myriad ways that don't involve huge datasets or complex statistical analysis.
	</p>
	<p>There is no right way to "do" text mining. Fundamentally, it allows historians to view, explore, and play with their sources. Use a variety of techniques!

	Bleeding-edge text mining work in the humanities, usually described in terms of automation and algorithmic approaches to huge data sets, make text mining seem like computer science hammers in search of humnaities nails.
	</p> 
	<p class="highlight">
	But the basic premise behind text mining--sketching out the contours of large or unorganized amounts of text--is something humanists do all the time. It does not require complex tools or visualizations.

	Isn't text mining fundamentally antithetical to the close reading that fuels humanistic inquiry and interpretation?
	How do we REALLY know what the computer is doing? How sure can we be that we've set it up to notice something worth noticing?
	</p>
	<p class="highlight">Counting words does not answer historical questions! True, but neither does reading or digging through archives. 
	</p>
	<p>
	A complex hermenutic process creates evidence from data. Text mining simply helps you analyze historical sources (and more of them) from multiple points of view.

<div class="section_first">
	<div class="section_header"><h2>multi-faceted & targeted exploration</h2></div>
	
	<div class="section_text">
	<p>
	It's surprisingly easy to use tools to explore texts and greatly improve research efficiency, especially for a small to intermediate amount of text. These techniques do not scale up to handle huge amounts of data, but most historians don't work with huge amounts of data. 
	</p>
	<p class="highlight">
	The machine's tolerance for mindless drudgery can be exploited with a highly guided approach that reduces the black-boxiness of an algorithmic approach.
	</p>
	<p>
	<span class="red_border">Let's use the <a href="http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/">Old Bailey Online</a>.</span> and  <a href="voyeurtools.org">Voyant</a> to explore the use of poison in the 19th century.
	We can collect trial documents by downloading cases we're interested in (you can get them 10 at a time <a href="http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/obapi/">from the API</a>). 
	Then, use a ZIP utility to bundle them together; this makes it easier to upload them to Voyant.
	<p>
	Look for words that might be informative. In this case, I searched for drink, drunk, ate, eaten, and et. 
	Zeroing in on those contexts, <span class="blue_border"> I see that "coffee" is one of the most common terms, and in fact one of the most common vehicles for poison.
	</span> 
	<p>
	Hardly a groundbreaking discovery, but it's a quick, targeted approach to making sense of documents on a scale not possible without computer mediation, but without expecting the machine to find interesting patterns on its own.

	<p>
	Of course you'll eventually want to do something that isn't possible with a specific tool. This is when the <a href="http://fredgibbs.net/blog/teaching/coding-in-the-humanities/">power of knowing a little bit of programming</a> (or perhaps more accurately, scritping) can be useful. 
	</p>
	<p>
	To cheer us up after the poisonings, let's tackle the nature of love in Jane Austen.  
	</p>
	<p>
	A simple tool, grep, can help direct your research by not just finding relevant words or phrases, but also by making it easy to compare them in context.
	</p>
	<p class="highlight">
	Learning how to create search expressions (like below) is no harder than navigating bilbiographic databases or learning research languages. 
	</p>
	<p>
	<span style="font-family:courier;line-height:2em;">grep -o ".\{0,50\}love.\{0,50\}"</span>
	</p>
	<p>
	Writing simple code is just like following a recipe (<a href="http://www.ericagamet.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Erica-Gamets-GREP-Cheat-Sheet.pdf">get a cheat sheet</a>). As you might guess, it means to display 50 characters on either side of the word "love."
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<span class="red_border">The output of this command collates all instances of "love".</span> Across many texts, this is a huge time saver. NOTE: you still need to read and interpret! (and probably do more searching)

	<p>What was sinful in the 19th century?</p>
	<p>
	Above, the corpus was small and well-defined. If a research corpus ranges more widely over sources and dates, you'll need to reformat and reorganize the data. 
	In this case, we'll gather texts from Google Books and isolate contexts around occurrances of mentions of "sinful" in Victorian literature. 
	Here, though, the raw data was more or less randomized, making a useful reading virtually impossible.
	</p>
	<p>
	<span class="red_border">A simple PHP script to reformat the results</span> can help take randomized data (often the way it is most efficiently collected or retrieved), and make it more readable.
	Is it reasonable to expect a historian to create this? Rather than create, one just needs to find solutions to similar problems. Most steps helpful in text mining have been solved already.
	The historians chore is to apply the ones most appropriate to facilitating interpretation.

	<span class="blue_border">The formatted results are ugly, but informative---organized here chronologically and by book.</span>

	<li>Approaching the process of text mining with an open mind helps us imagine how to use the various appropriate methodologies most effectively. </li>
	<li>Text mining is NOT necessarily about big data and complex algorithms, nor a substitute for reading, nor getting the computer to do historical analysis.</li>
	<li>Historical sources are data as much as text. Data can be inquired in different and profitable ways.</li>
	<li>Visualization is more about exploring sources and finding new questions than answering traditional questions.</li> 
	<li>Enhanced searching through basic search tools like grep and scripting languages like PHP can help you explore sources at new scales.</li>
