## Self-Evaluation
As this is my first formal annual review, I do not have any explicit goals to evaluate my performance against, so I'll just list some things I did and didn't do.

Courses taught in Fall 2013 did not go as well as I hoped, but I gained invaluable feedback from students (and of course from my own self-critiques) about how to improve them for next time, especially teaching effectively in a very different context from my previous teaching jobs. As the courses were extensively revised from earlier incarnations, I now have more ideas of how to refine them effectively.

On the research side, I finished and published 2 book reviews (as noted in the completed work section). 

In early summer 2013, I subbmited my revised dissertation manuscript to a series editor at Ashgate. I was hoping to revise and submit a final version of my manuscript within the calendar year, but it was delayed at the editor's desk until early 2014, so little progress beyond the initial submission was made in the 2013 calendar year. However, the series editor read and commented on my original draft in February, offering many important suggestions that will improve the final submission. Revisions are fervently underway.

While my manuscript was gathering dust in the editor's office, I had a phone conversation with an editor from the University of California Press who is interested in a new book project I've been sketching out, tentatively titled "The Aesthetics of Digital Scholarship." Although I have fleshed out some ideas into a short book proposal (which prompted the phone conversation), I have not yet produced any standalone articles on this project. That's a goal for 2014.

Some unexpected and substantial successes came after landing here at UNM in terms of making many connections to other faculty on campus interested in collaborating on large, interdisciplinary digital projects. These include Tim Castillo (director) and Adriane Zacmanidis of ARTSlab; Chris Wilson, Mark Childs, and Eric Bernard (director) from the School of Architecture and Planning; Aeron Haynie, Director of the Center for Teaching Excellence; Soraya Mota, in Electrical and Computer Engineering (with whom I'm collaborating for data collection and analysis in my Food course next fall); Chris Butler, in Political Science. Serving on the Faculty Senate Committee for Information and Technology Use keeps me in regular contact with Kevin Comerford, Director of Digital Initiatives at the Library, as well Johann von Reenan (Associate Vice President of Research) and Moira Gerety (Deputy CIO). I expect that these relationships will continue to develop over the summer and will result in several collaborative grant-writing efforts in the upcoming academic year.

In a larger academic context, I've been serving on a special History of Science Society Strategic Planning Committee (serving largely as a new media "expert"), which has been an excellent opportunity to discuss with a wide variety of senior scholars the opportunities, challenges, and dangers of open access publishing, new forms of scholarly communication, and digital scholarship--especially how these might be reshaping the way scholarly societies operate and what they offer their members.


## Goals for Upcoming Year
* Complete manuscript revisions and submit final manuscript for publication

* Begin grant writing and other project collaboration around campus for Digital Humanities projects

* Publish initial article leaning towards second project on the Aesthetics of Digital Scholarship

* Improve existing digital methods seminar and early medicine course after feedback from current year

* Fully develop course on Food, Diet, and Health to take advantage of Learning Studio space

* Implement redesigned digital methods course that is now split into a discussion and lab section to help students develop more technical skills

* Develop new synthetic, interdisciplinary, and digitally inflected undergraduate courses. My two favorite options right now are "Constructing Plague: The History and Science of an Epidemic" and "Objective Health: The History of Medical Data"
