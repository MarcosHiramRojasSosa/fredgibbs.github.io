Greetings! I'm Fred Gibbs, an assistant professor in the [history department](http://www.unm.edu/~hist/) at the [University of New Mexico](http://unm.edu). 

My current research interests span critical cartography, qualitative and historical GIS, spatial analytics, history of food production and distribution, history of food and diet, and environmental and urban history.

Previously, my research focused on premodern toxicology, as well as the theoretical and methodlogical implications of the rapidly changing interfaces between technology and history research. Perhaps the best way of getting a sense of what I've been up to is to peruse my various [publications](../publications) (please let me know if you cannot access something) and to read about my [ongoing projects](../projects).

Until the spring of 2013, I was an assistant professor in the department of history and art history at [George Mason University](http:///gmu.edu) (Fairfax, VA) and director of digital scholarship at the [Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media](http://chnm.gmu.edu).

I completed my History of Science PhD at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://wisc.edu), where I discovered a new interest in web design and development. For a few years before that, I did menial cubicle chores \[= web programming] (where I also built elaborate soda-can towers) after studying physics at [Carleton College](http://www.carleton.edu). I grew up in Prior Lake, MN, where I enjoyed riding bikes through neighbors' yards, playing incredibly mindless video games, and learning to get computers to do what I want.
