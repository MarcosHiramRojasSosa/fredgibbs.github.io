# Hello World!
I'm Fred Gibbs, an assistant professor in the [history department](http://history.unm.edu) at the [University of New Mexico](http://unm.edu). 

My historical research interests span the history of diet and health (particularly nutrition), the intersection of food and environmental histories (particularly food production and distribution), and qualitative and historical GIS (Geographic Information Systems).

My work in the digital humanities (digital history in particular) explores new modes of historical research and publishing, the importance of design in scholarship, the necessity for new evaluative criteria for digital scholarship (and the nature of scholarship in the 21st century), and sustainable publication practices that avoid the bloated costs and outmoded processes of most academic publishers.

I have been a general editor at [Programming Historian](http://programminghistorian.org) since 2012, co-founded in 2015 the UNM [Spatial Humanities Working Group](http://spatialhumanities.unm.edu), and serve as an editor at the recently (Oct 2016) launched [H-Nutrition](https://networks.h-net.org/h-nutrition) network on H-Net. Perhaps the best way of getting a sense of what I've been up to scroll through my [project portfolio](../projects), and check peruse some publications (and links to them) on [my CV](../cv).

Also, I like to make diletantish [posters](../posters).

Previously, my research focused on premodern toxicology, particularly medical literature on poison circa 1300 - 1600.


# History
Until the spring of 2013, I was an assistant professor in the department of History and Art History at [George Mason University](http:///gmu.edu) (Fairfax, VA) and director of digital scholarship at the [Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media](http://chnm.gmu.edu).

I completed my History of Science PhD at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://wisc.edu), where I discovered a new interest in web design and development. For a few years before that, I did menial cubicle chores \[= web programming] (where I also built elaborate soda-can towers) after studying physics at [Carleton College](http://www.carleton.edu). I grew up in Prior Lake, MN, where I enjoyed riding bikes through neighbors' yards, playing  mindless video games, and learning to get computers to do what I want.
