I'm Fred Gibbs, an assistant professor in the [history department](http://www.unm.edu/~hist/) at the [University of New Mexico](http://unm.edu). 

Until recently (spring 2013), I was an assistant professor in the department of history and art history at [George Mason University](http:///gmu.edu) (Fairfax, VA) and director of digital scholarship at the [Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media](http://chnm.gmu.edu).

I completed my History of Science PhD at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://wisc.edu) in 2009, where I discovered a new interest in web design and development. For a few years before that, I did menial cubicle chores (where i also built elaborate soda-can towers) after studying physics at [Carleton College](http://www.carleton.edu). I grew up in Prior Lake, MN, where I enjoyed riding bikes through neighbors' yards and playing incredibly mindless video games.

**What's in a name?**<br>
Early followers will recognize this website as the website formerly known as historyproef. Despite the brilliant reasons and motivations behind its original name and incarnation, it proved too impractical. Feel free to [read more about the name and its failure](../why-historyproef-had-to-die/ "why historyproef had to die").

Below is a **3rd-person short bio**, for copy and paste (~ 100 words):

Fred Gibbs is an assistant professor of history at the University of New Mexico. His research focuses on the intersection of natural philosophy and medicine in the late medieval and early modern periods. In his first book, he explores medical literature on poison c.1200-1600, especially how physicians debated its ontological existence and its role in disease causation and contagion. He also develops and executes both large and small digital humanities projects, most of which grapple with the theoretical and practical challenges of creating and using large datasets for historical research.
