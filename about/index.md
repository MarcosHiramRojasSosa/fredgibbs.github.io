Greetings! I'm Fred Gibbs, an assistant professor in the [history department](http://www.unm.edu/~hist/) at the [University of New Mexico](http://unm.edu). 

My academic research focuses on the intersection of digital humanities, history theory and historiography, information design, data criticism, and media studies. Perhaps the best way of getting a sense of what I'm interested in is to peruse my various [publications](../publications) (please let me know if you cannot access something) and to read about my [ongoing projects](../projects). 

Until the spring of 2013, I was an assistant professor in the department of history and art history at [George Mason University](http:///gmu.edu) (Fairfax, VA) and director of digital scholarship at the [Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media](http://chnm.gmu.edu).

I completed my History of Science PhD at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://wisc.edu) in 2009, where I discovered a new interest in web design and development. For a few years before that, I did menial cubicle chores \[= web programming] (where I also built elaborate soda-can towers) after studying physics at [Carleton College](http://www.carleton.edu). I grew up in Prior Lake, MN, where I enjoyed riding bikes through neighbors' yards and playing incredibly mindless video games.

**What's in a name?**<br>
Early followers will recognize this website as the website formerly known as historyproef. Despite the brilliant reasons and motivations behind its original name and incarnation, it proved too impractical. Feel free to [read more about the name and its failure](../posts/why-historyproef-had-to-die/ "why historyproef had to die").

Below is a **3rd-person short bio**, for copy and paste (~ 100 words):

Fred Gibbs is an assistant professor of history at the University of New Mexico, with a research focus on the intersection of natural philosophy and medicine in the late medieval and early modern periods. His manuscript-in-progress explores medical literature on poison c.1200-1600, especially how physicians debated its definition, properties, ontological existence, and its role in disease and contagion. He also experiments with digital methodologies that employ various mapping, text mining, and visualization techniques in the service of historical research. He teaches classes on the history of science and medicine, as well as digital humanities. More information at [http://fredgibbs.net](fredgibbs.net).
