Greetings! I'm Fred Gibbs, an assistant professor in the [history department](http://www.unm.edu/~hist/) at the [University of New Mexico](http://unm.edu). 

Until recently (spring 2013), I was an assistant professor in the department of history and art history at [George Mason University](http:///gmu.edu) (Fairfax, VA) and director of digital scholarship at the [Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media](http://chnm.gmu.edu).

My research interests lie in the confluence of medicine and natural philosophy in the medieval and early modern periods. I am currently finishing a manuscript on the nature of poison as discussed in medical literature from 1200-1600, especially its relationship to plague, contagion, disease. Grants and fellowships used to support this research are listed on my [CV](../cv). 
<!-- As has almost everyone else&#8217;s, my work has been supported by numerous research grants and fellowships, including those from the [National Science Foundation](http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=0551866), the [New York Academy of Medicine](http://www.nyam.org/grants/history-prev.html), and the [American Institute of the History of Pharmacy](http://www.pharmacy.wisc.edu/aihp).-->

[Most of my projects](../projects) unite historical scholarship with new digital research methodologies. These have included investigating the changing nature of early plague treatises, mapping botanical expeditions at the turn of the 20th century, and developing new techniques for understanding Victorian history through thousands of books. Most of these grapple with the theoretical and practical challenges of using (relatively) large datasets for historical research. 

At UNM, I [teach courses](../courses) on the digital humanities and on various topics in the history of science and medicine.

I completed my History of Science PhD at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://wisc.edu) in 2009. Before that, I programmed in a cubicle (where i also built elaborate soda-can towers) for a few years after studying physics at [Carleton College](http://www.carleton.edu).



**What's in a name?**
Early followers will recognize this website as the website formerly known as historyproef. Despite the brilliant reasons and motivations behind its original name and incarnation, it proved too impractical. Feel free to [read more about the name and its failure](../why-historyproef-had-to-die/ "why historyproef had to die").

Below is a **3rd-person short bio**, for copy and paste (~ 100 words):

Fred Gibbs is an assistant professor of history at the University of New Mexico. His research focuses on the intersection of natural philosophy and medicine in the late medieval and early modern periods. In his first book, he explores medical literature on poison c.1200-1600, especially how physicians debated its ontological existence and its role in disease causation and contagion. He also develops and executes both large and small digital humanities projects, most of which grapple with the theoretical and practical challenges of creating and using large datasets for historical research.
