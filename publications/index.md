## Other Stuff

"How Do We Make the Future?" A Contribution to the History of Science Society Newsletter (forthcoming July 2016) [with Erika Milam and Joanna Radin].

_Histories of the Future_ ([histscifi.com](http://histscifi.com))
This project was an experiment to see if a small academic workshop (on the history of science) could produce and make available a collection of scholarly work over a period of about a year in a web format that would encourage continuing contributions and be more visible than the results (and papers) from a typical academic workshop. I was responsible for designing and building the website, as well as migrating content to a sustainable web format and publishing the essays online. The project is still ongoing, but the editors (myself included) have been more distracted with traditional and necessary book projects than we anticipated, which has unfortunately dissipated energy from this project. But we are proud of what we produced as an experiment for making the work of a one-off workshop openly visible and available for specialists and non-specialists alike.
