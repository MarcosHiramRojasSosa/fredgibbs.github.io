## Overview

<div id="accordion">

### Course Description

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div>
Nobody reads much in libraries or archives anymore. We scour digital catalogs, identify relevant materials, take hundreds or thousands of photos, and download digital facsimiles and datasets.

This course explores the theoretical and methodological issues now facing humanists working in a digital age. Combining provocative readings from the field of Digital Humanities and gentle technical tutorials, we’ll talk about and experiment with powerful new research methodologies that now allow humanists to ask and answer fundamentally different kinds of questions, and use new media to communicate them in innovative ways. With an emphasis on collaborative teaching and learning, we'll explore topics such as digital workflows for organizing, accessing, and analyzing sources, data visualization, geospatial analysis, text mining, web publishing, and a bit of programming.

This course challenges and complements the typical conventions for humanities research, as well as provide guidelines for effectively bridging and combining humanities and technology skills that will **make you more employable**, however you intend to use your humanities degree.

The course meets 2 days a week for 1.25 hours; on Monday we’ll discuss readings and theorize about methods; on Wednesday, which will be more like a lab section, we’ll develop particular digital skills, such as functional webpages, maps with GIS tools, basic text mining, and data visualization tools and techniques. 

All the while, we'll be working together to create an online Digital History of Albuquerque, where each students will contribute to a facet most relevant to their own research.

### Student Learning Outcomes
{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div>

- Develop conversational fluency: understand current debates and speak intelligently with both skeptics and advocates about the history and future of digital scholarship and its relationship to the world.

- Appreciate the theoretical possibilities and practical limitations of digital archives and new research methodologies.

- Begin to experiment with new tools, workflows, methods, and techniques for large-scale research questions in the humanities.

- Understand the theories and principles of new media and its potential impact on scholarly communication.

</div>

### Work Requirements and Grading
{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div>

- Thorough preparedness and engaged participation in every class meeting. See the note about readings and discussion below. (40%)

- Create and use your own blog and Twitter account for the course. (5%)

- Original 400-word critical reaction blog posts posted to your own blog before each class. I will supply a brief prompt for these to help focus your posts on key issues. These should NOT merely summarize the readings, but critically evaluate them and ask questions that will guide our discussion. You need to do 7 of these throughout the semester. (30%)

- Lead one discussion by having good questions prepared ahead of time to help call attention to interesting points in the readings, connect them to each other, and connect that day’s readings to previous readings and discussions. (5%)

- As a final project, create a 5 minute "video" that showcases the methods and results of your MA or PhD research (whatever stage you're at). We'll cover tools and techniques for doing this extensively in class. (15%)

- Perseverance and tolerance for frustration. Digital humanities engages with new methodological problems and professional challenges raised by rapidly shifting technology and new media. Must be able to have fun while groping, even when it take twice as long as you expected. (5%)

### 1. The Digital Humanities Phenomenon
{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div>
#### Ethos of Digital Humanities
What *is* digital humanities? How does studying "the digital" vs. using "the digital" factor into definitions? Is it necessary to have a working definition?

### 2. Core Principles of the Digital Humanities
{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div>

#### A DH Manifesto 
What are the central concerns of the so-called digital humanities community? Does it make sense to talk about Digital Humanities as opposed to Digital History or Digital Literature? Why is there no Digital Philosophy?

#### LAB: Digital Humanities Projects Review
We'll delve into some of the debates about the nature of "DH" and also begin exploring some (online) projects (whether focused on presenting archives, interpretation, methodology, exhibits, etc) to get a better feel for the digital footprint of DH.

### 4. From *the* archives to *your* archive 
{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div>
#### DISCUSSION
There are great digital datasets available, but most historians work with sources that are far from ready to be plugged into digital tools. This group of readings suggests some techniques and strategies to make traditional analog sources suitable for use in a digital workflow. Everyone has to choose the set of tools and workflow that's appropriate to their own needs and habits. But having an open mind and flexibility in adjusting your own work habits can go a long way towards lowering the impedance between you and digital tools that can help your productivity skyrocket, and in fact allow you to venture into unchartered historical waters.
