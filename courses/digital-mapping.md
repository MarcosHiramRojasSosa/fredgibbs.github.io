## Overview

<div id="accordion">

### Course Description
{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div>
We are in the midst of a major paradigm shift in human  consciousness and society caused by a new ubiquitous connectedness via the internet and smartphones. These globalizing forces have telescoped space and time to an unprecedented degree, while paradoxically heightening the importance of local places.

The course explores the tools and workflows used to collect, connect, and present online interpretations of the spaces around us. After an introduction to the theoretical and practical challenges of deep mapping (producing rich, interactive maps with multiple layers of information), we’ll produce digital maps of Albuquerque using various mobile apps for data collection, online exhibit software like Omeka and Story Maps, as well as mapping tools like Google Earth and QGIS that leverage the power of open data from local and national repositories to provide new perspectives on the built environment.

All the while, we'll be working together to create an online Digital History of Albuquerque, where each students will contribute to a facet most relevant to their own research.

### How get the most out of this course
{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div>

- Perseverance and tolerance for frustration. Digital humanities engages with new methodological problems and professional challenges raised by rapidly shifting technology and new media. Must be able to have fun while groping, even when it takes way longer than expected. (5%)

#### Origins of Spatial Humanities
Guest Speaker: Chris Wilson, J. B. Jackson Professor of Cultural Landscape Studies at the University of New Mexico School of Architecture and Planning

#### Planning Our ABQ Map Project

We need to make a map with a particular focus on something (it could be water, commuting, local food, farming, education, history). Best pizza, biking roads, empty lots, historic neighborhoods

A few requirements: We have to have data we can gather or research to do; it has to have a spatial and historical component. 

Some potential projects:
What should the modern walking tour look like? (i.e. how to explore past and present of built environment?)
move from historic places to historic spaces. what does it mean not to focus on building, but the area around it. what allowed that building to exist meaningfully? what does it mean now? how can it inform community building

more logistics:
what is group effort? what will individual contributions be?
what geographic areas specifically will be targeted?
divide responsibilities; create project teams

#### Web Mapping Basics
How to create your own interactive maps online


Set up localized web environments
[MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/)
[WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/)

read up to JAVASCRIPT section in [Interactive Data Visualization for the Web](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/ch03.html)


make a simple webpage.
add a simple google map.

ALTERNATIVES TO GOOGLE
reasons not to use google:
don’t want to be beholden to their terms of service
various copyright and privacy issues
they look like google maps, you might want something more unique


You might not always want to use google. that’s okay, there several excellent alternatives:

- [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org/)
- [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start.html)


No matter what library you use for putting a map on your webpage, you can get tiles from a number of places:

[Stamen Maps](http://maps.stamen.com/#watercolor/11/35.1000/-106.5100)


another tool for linking your own data and styling it

https://www.mapbox.com/ (gives you a limited web editor to produce custom tiles)

for more flexibility, use a desktop editor called tilemill

https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/
https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/crashcourse/introduction/

these allow for custom interactivity, which you can publish on mapbox (free account gives you limited space, of course), and you can load these onto any web page
