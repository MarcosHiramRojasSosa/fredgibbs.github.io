## Course Description

This course introduces some of the most influential approaches that historians (from antiquity through the 21st century) have taken in crafting their interpretations of the past. It addresses various philosophies of history (the underlying assumptions of how we can access and understand the past), as well as various historical interpretive frameworks that have shaped the professional practice of history.


## Student Learning Outcomes

* Demonstrate the ability to compare and contrast different processes, modes of thought, and modes of expression from different historical time periods and in different geographic areas.

* Understand how and why historians have argued about philosophical methodological approaches to their craft over time, and what cultural changes precepitated new views.

* Recognize and articulate the diversity of human experience, including ethnicity, race, language, sex, gender, as well as political, economic, social, and cultural structures over time and space.

* Formulate a clear argument, support the argument with appropriate and thorough evidence, and reach a convincing conclusion.

* Provide accurate references to historical sources used in research projects.


## General Expectations

* As a senior-level seminar, attendance is crucial to your success. However, simply showing up to class counts for very little; I expect that you'll actively participate in all discussions, presentations, and activities. If you are shy about speaking in class, don't worry. You will become much more comfortable and fluent by the end of the semester. But it is an essential skill that much be practiced, and this is the perfect place to do so. Please come see me if you'd like to discuss how we can make this easier for you.

* You cannot make up missed classes and I will not summarize them for you via email. Please DO NOT email me asking what you missed or how to make it up (feel free to ask your class colleagues for notes). Medical emergencies beyond your control are the one exception to the attendance policy, and you should let me know about these ASAP.

* I consider it extremely rude and disruptive to walk into class late, and it greatly aggravates me. Everyone makes mistakes, and I undertstand you might be (barely) late once or twice. Repeatedly being late will negatively impact your grade by a third to full letter grade.

* If you run into personal problems during the semester that make school difficult for you, please talk to me about what adjustments we can make to help you succeed in the course.


## Work Requirements and Grading

Although I do not calcuate grades mathematically, I have provided percetages to indicate how much relative weight each component of the course receives in my evaluation of student performance.

- Active and thoughtful participation in class discussions (40%)

- Preparation work for each class (25%)

We'll divide the class into 3 groups (as equal as possible). Each student will belong to one of these groups for each class and will continually rotate through the groups during the semester, changing groups each class.

1. **Summarizers:** The summarizers will prepare a 1-page bullet-point summary of the assigned readings. You will work on these independently (though you can work together if you want), but you must present them collectively at the beginning of class as a way of reminding everyone what they've read.

2. **Commenters:** The commenters will post a 500-word critical comment on the readings the night before each class. These should be high quality but informal writing, like you were writing for a top-shelf literary magazine--you should have an opinion and have fun writing about it. You must resist the urge to summarize the readings (we have summarizers to do that!).  

3. **Discussion Guides:** The discussion guides will come to class with questions that will help guide discussion for that class. Examiners should draw from the Commenters and incorporate on-the-fly as much as possible from the Summarizers. I will help guide discussions each day, but I expect the examiners to do the bulk of the work.

For this component, you will be evaluted on the extent to which your comments, summaries, and questions show your engagement with that assignment and its relationship to the course. It's not practical for me to assign specifc letter grades to each of these individually, so I make general comments about them each class, highlighting excellent work and nudging the slackers to step it up. 
 
- ~5-minute video book review. We will discuss this much more in class, both the historiographical and technical components. No experience required! (15%)

- FINAL ESSAY: Pick a book off the shelf of the historiography section of Zimmerman Library. Write a 1500 word book review, drawing primarily from course readings and sources they reference. This is your big and final chance to show off what you learned in the course. While some summary is necessary, of course, your essay should focus on situating the book in historical and historiographical context. The more sophisticated your analysis, the higher your grade.  (20%)

- FINAL GRADES: Because most of your work in this course is not assigned a specific letter grade, and because such an approach hardly captures all the intangible factors that go into a grade, here's my functional approach to grading this upper level history course. Basically, everyone starts with a B, and you gradually move it up or down depending on the consistency and quality of your work. If you are contributing thoughtfully to discussions, your grade moves to a B+. If you are consistently putting work into the preparation assignments, your grade moves to an A-. You can also move your grade down by not participating in class, or with superficial preparation assignments. Not showing up and/or turning in work late lowers your grade very quickly. The video and final essay do get specific grade attached to them, and they raise or lower your grade depending on how much higher or lower they are from what you've earned so far.

Please feel free to talk to me about your individual performance at any time during the semester, as often as you'd like. Please do not email about this; a conversation is far more useful and efficient. Right before or after class is a good time.

Although I have kept the reading load rather light, the assignments are often quite dense and conceptually challenging. This is by design, as a capstone course for the history department. Be honest with yourself about whether you have time to fit this course into your busy schedules. One of the goals of the course is that you will learn to read and absorb information more quickly than you can already. That skill is hard-earned, and only comes with practice.
