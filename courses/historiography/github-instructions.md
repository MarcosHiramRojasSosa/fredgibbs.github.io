To manage all the work that you will submit before each class meeting, we use a website/service called [GitHub](github.com). It's a great archival tool that will allow us to share our work, manage different versions of files, and keep our materials organized throughout the semester. 

A quick warning: GitHub is used primarily by programmers working on collaborative coding projects, which means that the interface is highly utilitarian and there are technical terms everywhere---so it can seem rather intimidating. **Do not worry!** You don't need to understand anything about GitHub other than a few easy steps, outlined below:

1. [Create a free account](https://github.com/join). It takes 30 seconds, and you need only a username and password and email address; you will never get any kind of spam.
2. [Log in to GitHub](https://github.com/login). There's a 'Sign in' button in the upper right, if you're not on the homepage.
3. Visit the course repository, using the URL on the syllabus.
3. Click on the appropriate folder to which you would like to add your comment.
4. Click the gray 'Create new file' button next (to the left of the more noticable green 'Clone or download' button). If you don't see this button, you aren't logged in. Look in the upper-right corner for the 'Sign in' link.
5. For the name of the file (the input box is just above the big space where you'll paste your comment), use Lastname-comment.md. So, I'd put Gibbs-comment.md in the input box for my comment. **All files should end with .md**
6. Cut and paste your comment into the big text box. Just to be clear, you are not uploading a file, you are cutting and pasting text into the box.
7. If you want to style/format your text, follow the [Markdown guide](https://https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/). It's really quite easy, albeit probably a bit foreign at first.
8. Click "Commit new file" at the bottom of the page. If you can't click it, you probably forgot to enter a filename.
9. Enjoy a refreshing cocktail.
