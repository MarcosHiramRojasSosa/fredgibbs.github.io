## Critiquing Digital Scholarship
We'll begin exploring some [DH projects](http://dhcommons.org/projects) (whether focused on presenting archives, interpretation, methodology, exhibits, etc) to get a better feel for the digital footprint of DH.

What are the fundamental criteria for critiquing digital history projects? How much does the traditional peer review model need to change to accommodate new types of historical work/projects?

## Digital Spatial History

Ian Gregory and David Cooper    
[GIS, Texts, and Images: New Approaches](http://journals.tdl.org/paj/index.php/paj/article/view/20).

Prepare critiques of some [DH GIS Projects](http://anterotesis.com/wordpress/dh-gis-projects/)

Read "Introducing GIS" and "Vector Data" from this [gentle introduction to GIS](http://docs.qgis.org/2.2/en/docs/gentle_gis_introduction/index.html).

Download and install [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/). Your job is just to get the application running on your computer. Note: if you have a Mac, you have to install 2 required packages before installing QGIS; follow the instructions carefully (kyngchaos is your friend)! We'll troubleshoot any installation issues and go over the interface and other basic GIS concepts in class.

Understand the [basics of KML](https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kml_tut).      

Add a simple Google map [using these instructions](https://developers.google.com/maps/tutorials/fundamentals/adding-a-google-map). Do not proceed to the next step until this is working!


## Mapping with QGIS

Return to the [gentle introduction to GIS](http://docs.qgis.org/2.2/en/docs/gentle_gis_introduction/index.html), reading up through "Coordinate Reference Systems".

Create some interesting, even if useless, maps by overlaying totally different data sets.

If you get stuck or have questions, consult the [QGIS Training Manual](http://docs.qgis.org/2.2/en/docs/training_manual/), [the QGIS wiki](http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/wiki/How_do_I_do_that_in_QGIS), and an [array of tutorials](http://qgistutorials.com).

## Text Mining 
Under what circumstances are these techniques useful? How can they be used most effectively?

Get some of your research data loaded into [Bookworm](http://bookworm.culturomics.org/) and [Voyant](http://voyant-tools.org/) (and you might want to peruse [a list of projects that have used it](http://docs.voyant-tools.org/about/examples-gallery/).

We're going to talk about the different formats of data these tools require, problems moving from one to the other; pros and cons of their various approaches, and whatever you newly discovered about your sources from taking a broad view.
