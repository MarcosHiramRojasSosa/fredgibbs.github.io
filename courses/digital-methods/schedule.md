# DRAFT VERSION! 
This syllabus is still under construction and changes frequently. You can, however, consider this a mostly accurate guide to the approach of the class, especially the topics we'll cover and the kinds of activities we'll be doing.

In general, we will spend the beginning part of classes talking about the assignment due that day, addressing questions or concerns that arose while completing it, troubleshooting, and discussing more technical aspects of the tool/method and its practical utility. Then we'll move on to the next tool/method with a general introduction, discussion of its potentials and limitations, work through some tutorials, and go over the assignment for the next meeting (and make sure everyone is ready to tackle it).

Very rarely are all readings listed required (though all assignments are); I try to list relevant readings that I think are worth knowing about and allow everyone to focus on what's most interesting to them and bring their interests and perspectives to our discussions.


## Ethos of Digital Humanities / Digital Historigraphy

### Before Class
William Cronon, [The Public Practice of History in and for a Digital Age](http://www.historians.org/perspectives/issues/2012/1201/The-Public-Practice-of-History-in-and-for-a-Digital-Age.cfm).

### In Class
- Introduction to [Zotero](http://zotero.org), [GitHub](http://github.com) (+ version control with git), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#intro). 
- Set up GitHub, Twitter, and Zotero accounts.
- Create a simple website with GitHub.



## The Command Line

Some of the most powerful tools you might use for digital research and publishing don't have a GUI (Graphical User Interface) for many reasons that we'll discuss. If you haven't used a command line interface before, it can be disorienting, but we'll try for a very gentle introduction.

If you have Windows, you'll need to use PowerShell; if you have a Mac, you'll need to use your Terminal application. For our purposes, they are functionally equivalent.

### In class (read through docs beforehand, but we'll go through them in class with some deviations)
- [Intro to bash](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/intro-to-bash).
- Download and install [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/installing.html).
- Download and install [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php).
- We'll work through some basic examples of these tools.



## Digital Publishing

We'll use our new knowledge of the command line and several tutorials to help us install Jekyll (which is what GitHub uses) and manage our websites more easily. First, we'll talk about different strategies for and reasons why you might want to be more hands on with your own digital presence.

### In class
We'll work through the process of creating a basic Google Map from historical sources. The point isn't to make super sexy maps, but to understand all the steps involved in the process and how you should or should not apply various mapping techniques in your own work. 

Understand the [basics of KML](https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kml_tut) and ways of sharing data.


## Mapping with QGIS

### Before class
Prepare reviews of some relevant [DH GIS Projects](http://anterotesis.com/wordpress/dh-gis-projects/)

Download and install [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/). Note: if you have a Mac, you have to install 2 required packages before installing QGIS; follow the instructions carefully (kyngchaos is your friend)! We'll troubleshoot any installation issues and go over the interface and other basic GIS concepts in class.

## Research Trailers
Create a video about your research! We'll explore some tools and techniques for doing this, and we'll continue to discuss the videos and our production schedule throughout the semester. 



## Text Mining 
Under what circumstances are these techniques useful? How can they be used most effectively? We're going to talk about the different formats of data these tools require, problems moving from one to the other; pros and cons of their various approaches, and whatever you newly discovered about your sources from taking a broad view of your sources/data.
