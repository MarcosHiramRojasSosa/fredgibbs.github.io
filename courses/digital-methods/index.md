## Course Description
This course explores new theoretical and methodological possibilities now available to historians working in the digital age. Combining provocative readings from the Digital Humanities with introductory tutorials on various digital methods (which build technical proficiency generally), we’ll talk about and experiment with powerful new research methodologies that now allow historians to ask and answer fundamentally different kinds of questions and innovatively communicate about them with new media. With an emphasis on collaborative teaching and learning, we'll explore topics such as digital workflows for accessing or organizing sources, data visualization, digital mapping and geospatial analysis, and topic modeling. We'll also examine new models for peer review and academic publishing, develop skills in web typography and design, and create a short video. This course both challenges and complements typical history methods courses, as well as provides strategies for effectively combining qualitative and quantitative research skills. Over the course of the semester, students will design, code, and publish their own website that will showcase their research and digital skills. No technical skills or experience is required for this course, but you will need to have a laptop that you can bring to class.


## Student Learning Outcomes
- Develop conversational fluency: understand current debates and speak intelligently with both skeptics and advocates about the history and future of digital scholarship and its relationship to the world.

- Appreciate the theoretical possibilities and practical limitations of digital archives and new research methodologies.

- Understand the theories and principles of new media and its potential impact on scholarly communication.

- Begin to experiment with new tools, workflows, methods, and techniques for large-scale research questions in the humanities; become able to teach yourself technical skills as needed.



## Work Requirements and Grading
- Thorough preparedness and engaged participation in every class meeting and in the class project. (20%)

- Weekly 750-word blog posts that critically engage with both the readings and your experience working through some of the tutorials. This posts not only give you the opportunity to describe your mastery of the readings (as per a more traditional seminar), they also give you a chance to foregound the hard work you're doing, even when you can't get everything to "work". Your blog posts will be evalutated in terms of the quality of their original and thoughtful contribution to the overall course discussion, as well as serious engagement with the technical challenges. (25%)

- In lieu of a final exam or project, over the course of the semester you will create a digital portfolio hosted at GitHub, composed by hand in a text editor with Markdown, HTML and CSS. There is no formal structure requirement. However you assemble it, your portfolio must show you completing the technical assignments and attempting to apply the techniques in the course to your own research. You might also indicate what you might do with considerable more time and expertise. Some of your portfolio will serve particular course needs, and you might jettison those componenets when the course ends, but hopefully you'll have a core of a professional website that will continue to benefit your career. (30%)

Your portfolio must include:

- some kind of landing page or home page (with some design strategy behind it) that gives some idea of the site's contents
- a page dedicated to explaining--and ideally illustrating--your research, especially its value and significance
- a mostly or entirely complete curriculum vitae / resume
- a description and screenshots of you using QGIS to plot multiple data layers somehow related to your research. 
- topic models of relevant texts
- critical review of digital projects in your field. What exists? How could they be better? What should new projects be doing? If there is not much to report, then write a short manifesto about how the "digital humanities" values and ethos might serve (or not!) your field.
 
- A 5-minute "video" that showcases the methods, results, and significance of your MA or PhD research (whatever stage you're at). We'll cover tools and techniques for doing this in class (10%)

- Lead one discussion by having good questions prepared ahead of time to help call attention to interesting points in the readings, connect them to each other, and connect that day’s readings to previous readings and discussions. (10%)

- Perseverance and tolerance for frustration. Digital humanities engages with new methodological problems and professional challenges raised by rapidly shifting technology and new media. Must be able to have fun while groping, even when it takes WAY longer than you expected. (5%)
