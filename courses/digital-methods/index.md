### Course Description
This course explores new theoretical and methodological issues now facing humanists working in a digital age, as well as old issues that have taken a new form. Combining provocative readings from the emergent field "Digital Humanities" with gentle technical tutorials that improve digital skills, we’ll talk about and experiment with powerful new research methodologies that now allow humanists to ask and answer fundamentally different kinds of questions and use new media to communicate about them in innovative ways. With an emphasis on collaborative teaching and learning, we'll explore topics such as digital workflows for organizing, accessing, and analyzing sources, data visualization, geospatial analysis, text mining, web publishing, and a bit of programming.

This course challenges and complements the typical conventions for humanities research, as well as provide guidelines for effectively bridging and combining humanities and technology skills that will **make you more considerably employable than your colleagues who remain afraid of data**, however you intend to use your humanities degree.

The course meets 2 days a week for 1.25 hours. Generally, on Wednesday we’ll discuss readings and theorize about methods; on Friday, which will be more like a lab section, we’ll develop particular digital skills, such as developing functional webpages, maps with GIS tools, basic text mining techniques, and data visualization tools. 

All the while, we'll be collaborating to create an online **History of the ABQ Airport**, which will entail new historical research at the Center for the Southwest Research and other local archives, as well as other project skills such as digitization and digital workflows, content management, web development, design, and marketing.


### Student Learning Outcomes
- Develop conversational fluency: understand current debates and speak intelligently with both skeptics and advocates about the history and future of digital scholarship and its relationship to the world.

- Appreciate the theoretical possibilities and practical limitations of digital archives and new research methodologies.

- Understand the theories and principles of new media and its potential impact on scholarly communication.

- Begin to experiment with new tools, workflows, methods, and techniques for large-scale research questions in the humanities; become able to teach yourself technical skills as needed.



### Work Requirements and Grading
- Thorough preparedness and engaged participation in every class meeting and in the class project. (40%)

- [ORIGINAL] Original 400-word critical reaction essays posted to your own blog before each class. These should NOT merely summarize the readings, but critically evaluate them and ask questions that will guide our discussion and relate the readings to each other. You need to do 6 of these throughout the semester. You can also blog about your experience working through some of the tutorials (30%)

- [MODIFIED Oct. 3rd] You should blog (~500 words, but there is no official min or max) at least once per week about waht you're reading, your experience working through a tutorial, or your effort to complete on of the assignments. If responding to the readings, you should describe what you found interesting, novel, exciting, boring, impossible, delusional, etc. For the tutorials or for the particular assignment (create a map, topic model, javascript tutorial), you should describe what you've learned in the process regardless of how far you were able to go. This gives you a chance to foregound the hard work you're doing so that it is less important that you get everything to "work", and more important that you can think critically about what you've done, what you haven't, and articulate what you've learned. These short posts will I hope improve the utility of the assignments, help me address concerns during class, and evaluate your performance in the course. (20%)


- [ORIGINAL] As a final project, create a [digital humanities start-up grant](http://www.neh.gov/grants/odh/digital-humanities-start-grants) or [digital public project grant](http://www.neh.gov/grants/public/digital-projects-the-public) that showcases how you can use the kinds of skills, methods, and ideas presented in the course in your own work/project (related or not to current research interests). You don't need to limit yourself to what you can actually do at that time, but you must include small examples of your own methodological explorations learned in this course as proof-of-concept examples. We'll talk much more about this throughout the course, and you'll be working on them in stages near the end of the term. 

- [MODIFIED Oct. 3rd] As a final project / exam, you must create a digital portfolio hosted at your own ReclaimHosting domain, composed by hand in a text editor HTML and CSS (ie do not use web design software to write the code for you). There is no formal structure requirements in terms of precisely what pages you need to have or how it needs to be organized (you might have a single page for the maps, even though there are 2 distinct. I'd prefer that you make these decisions yourself (it's your site!). However you assemble it, your portfolio must demonstrate you applying the techniques in the course to your own research, even if in a contrived, trivial way. Essentially, your portfolio will function as a lab notebook for everything you'll do this semester. Some of it you'll jettison when the course ends, but hopefully you'll have a core of a professional website that will continue to benefit your career. (20%)

It must include:    
- some kind of landing page or home page (ideally with some design strategy behind it) that gives some idea of the site's contents
- a page dedicated to explaining--and ideally illustrating--your research, especially its value and significance (this might include your video as well)    
- a mostly or entirely complete curriculum vitae / resume    
- a description and screenshots of you using QGIS to plot multiple data layers somehow related to your research. This does not assume you are doing a spatially oriented project -- be creative!    
- a basic web map with your own data (this will demonstrate javascript skills as well)    
- a description of your cleaning data (this could be spatial data; it could be cleaning up digital texts)
- use of a small and siumple python program to automate some aspect of your research process
- description and screenshots of you using text mining tools to investigate relevant research texts
- topic models of relevant texts using MALLET 
- your short video about your research
- digial project review of digital projects in your field. What exists? How could they be better? What should new projects be doing? If there is not much to report, then write a short manifesto about how the "digital humanities" values and ethos might serve (or not!) your field.

- [MODIFIED Oct. 3rd] Good faith contributions to the ABQ Airport History Project. Particular roles and duties will be decided in class according to your own interests. This will be a public project that we want to show off at the end of the semester, so as long as you're doing work that you're proud of (you're name will be on it), this requirement will be successfully fulfilled. 

- A 3 to 6 minute "video" that showcases the methods, results, and significance of your MA or PhD research (whatever stage you're at). We'll cover tools and techniques for doing this in class; I'll bring goodies to our screening day. (5%)

- Create and use your own blog and Twitter account for the course. (5%)

- Lead one discussion by having good questions prepared ahead of time to help call attention to interesting points in the readings, connect them to each other, and connect that day’s readings to previous readings and discussions. (5%)

- Perseverance and tolerance for frustration. Digital humanities engages with new methodological problems and professional challenges raised by rapidly shifting technology and new media. Must be able to have fun while groping, even when it take twice as long (usually more) as you expected. (5%)
