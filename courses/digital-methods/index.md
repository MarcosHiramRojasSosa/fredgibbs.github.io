### Course Description
Nobody reads much in libraries or archives anymore. We scour digital catalogs, identify relevant materials, take hundreds or thousands of photos, and download digital facsimiles and datasets.

This course explores the theoretical and methodological issues now facing humanists working in a digital age. Combining provocative readings from the field of Digital Humanities and gentle technical tutorials, we’ll talk about and experiment with powerful new research methodologies that now allow humanists to ask and answer fundamentally different kinds of questions, and use new media to communicate them in innovative ways. With an emphasis on collaborative teaching and learning, we'll explore topics such as digital workflows for organizing, accessing, and analyzing sources, data visualization, geospatial analysis, text mining, web publishing, and a bit of programming.

This course challenges and complements the typical conventions for humanities research, as well as provide guidelines for effectively bridging and combining humanities and technology skills that will **make you more employable**, however you intend to use your humanities degree.

The course meets 2 days a week for 1.25 hours; on Monday we’ll discuss readings and theorize about methods; on Wednesday, which will be more like a lab section, we’ll develop particular digital skills, such as functional webpages, maps with GIS tools, basic text mining, and data visualization tools and techniques. 

All the while, we'll be working together to create an online Digital History of Albuquerque, where each students will contribute to a facet most relevant to their own research. 

### Student Learning Outcomes
- Develop conversational fluency: understand current debates and speak intelligently with both skeptics and advocates about the history and future of digital scholarship and its relationship to the world.

- Appreciate the theoretical possibilities and practical limitations of digital archives and new research methodologies.

- Begin to experiment with new tools, workflows, methods, and techniques for large-scale research questions in the humanities.

- Understand the theories and principles of new media and its potential impact on scholarly communication.


### Work Requirements and Grading
- Thorough preparedness and engaged participation in every class meeting. See the note about readings and discussion below. (40%)

- Create and use your own blog and Twitter account for the course. (5%)

- Original 400-word critical reaction blog posts posted to your own blog before each class. I will supply a brief prompt for these to help focus your posts on key issues. These should NOT merely summarize the readings, but critically evaluate them and ask questions that will guide our discussion. You need to do 7 of these throughout the semester. (30%)

- Lead one discussion by having good questions prepared ahead of time to help call attention to interesting points in the readings, connect them to each other, and connect that day’s readings to previous readings and discussions. (5%)

- As a final project, create a 5 minute "video" that showcases the methods and results of your MA or PhD research (whatever stage you're at). We'll cover tools and techniques for doing this extensively in class. (15%)

- Perseverance and tolerance for frustration. Digital humanities engages with new methodological problems and professional challenges raised by rapidly shifting technology and new media. Must be able to have fun while groping, even when it take twice as long as you expected. (5%)
