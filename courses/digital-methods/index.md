### Course Description
This course explores new theoretical and methodological issues now facing humanists working in a digital age, as well as old issues that have taken a new form. Combining provocative readings from the emergent field "Digital Humanities" with gentle technical tutorials that improve digital skills, we’ll talk about and experiment with powerful new research methodologies that now allow humanists to ask and answer fundamentally different kinds of questions and use new media to communicate about them in innovative ways. With an emphasis on collaborative teaching and learning, we'll explore topics such as digital workflows for organizing, accessing, and analyzing sources, data visualization, geospatial analysis, text mining, web publishing, and a bit of programming.

This course challenges and complements the typical conventions for humanities research, as well as provide guidelines for effectively bridging and combining humanities and technology skills that will **make you more considerably employable than your colleagues who remain afraid of data**, however you intend to use your humanities degree.

The course meets 2 days a week for 1.25 hours. Generally, on Monday we’ll discuss readings and theorize about methods; on Wednesday, which will be more like a lab section, we’ll develop particular digital skills, such as developing functional webpages, maps with GIS tools, basic text mining techniques, and data visualization tools. 

All the while, we'll be collaborating to create an online **History of the ABQ Airport**, which will entail new historical research at the Center for the Southwest Research and other local archives, digitization, content management, web development, design, and public history. 


### Student Learning Outcomes
- Develop conversational fluency: understand current debates and speak intelligently with both skeptics and advocates about the history and future of digital scholarship and its relationship to the world.

- Appreciate the theoretical possibilities and practical limitations of digital archives and new research methodologies.

- Understand the theories and principles of new media and its potential impact on scholarly communication.

- Begin to experiment with new tools, workflows, methods, and techniques for large-scale research questions in the humanities; become able to teach yourself technical skills as needed.



### Work Requirements and Grading
- Thorough preparedness and engaged participation in every class meeting and in the class project. (40%)

- Original 400-word critical reaction essays posted to your own blog before each class. These should NOT merely summarize the readings, but critically evaluate them and ask questions that will guide our discussion and relate the readings to each other. You need to do 6 of these throughout the semester. (30%)

- As a final project, create a 5-minute "video" that showcases the methods and results of your MA or PhD research (whatever stage you're at). We'll cover tools and techniques for doing this in class. (15%)

- Create and use your own blog and Twitter account for the course. (5%)

- Lead one discussion by having good questions prepared ahead of time to help call attention to interesting points in the readings, connect them to each other, and connect that day’s readings to previous readings and discussions. (5%)

- Perseverance and tolerance for frustration. Digital humanities engages with new methodological problems and professional challenges raised by rapidly shifting technology and new media. Must be able to tolerate frustation and to have fun while groping, even when it take twice as long as you expected. (5%)
