      <p>This course explores the theoretical and methodological issues now facing humanists working in a digital age. Combining provocative readings from the field of Digital Humanities and gentle technical tutorials, we’ll talk about and experiment with powerful new research methodologies that now allow humanists to ask and answer fundamentally different kinds of questions, and use new media to communicate them in innovative ways. With an emphasis on collaborative teaching and learning, we’ll explore topics such as digital workflows for organizing, accessing, and analyzing sources, data visualization, geospatial analysis, text mining, web publishing, and a bit of programming.</p>

      <p>What constitutes healthy food? Or a healthy diet? Or a healthy body? Needless to say, dietary regimens to restore or maintain health&em;as well as what it means to be healthy&em;have remained preeminent questions throughout Western medical history. Yet even today, medical understandings of diet and official dietary advice seems to change almost daily. This course explores how various cultural, scientific, and medical values have continually shaped our relationship to food, health, and diet from the Renaissance until now.</p>

      <p>Some guiding questions: Why have fad diets come in and gone out of fashion? How has modern medicine continually redefined what it means to be healthy and to eat a healthy diet? How have changing attitudes about the body, health, and technology shaped our dietary preferences?</p>

    <div class="course-desc">  
      <p>  This course explores the nature of science and medicine in Western Europe roughly spanning 400–1400. After a brief introduction to the crucial contributions in natural philosophy and medicine from the classical world, we’ll examine how various social, cultural, and institutional structures influenced medieval understandings of the world. In terms of specific topics, we’ll look at cosmology, astronomy, astrology, alchemy, chemistry, natural history, physics, and philosophy. We’ll also investigate broader themes, such as the theoretical and practical sides of medieval medicine, the contributions of Islamic culture to Western science, interactions between science and religion (especially natural philosophy and theology), and the university’s rise and influence on the Western intellectual tradition. While surveying the context of medieval frameworks for investigating and explaining the natural world, we’ll also reflect on the nature and utility of the term “science,” the extent to which the origins of modern science can be located in the Middle Ages, and the importance of putting the modern scientific enterprise in historical perspective.</p>
