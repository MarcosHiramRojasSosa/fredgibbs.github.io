### Course Description
This course surveys the so-called Scientific Revolution (SR), the supposedly fundamental shift in the way people began to investigate and understand nature between roughly 1550-1750--a period that is still described as the "birth of modern science." But what is the nature of a scientific revolution? What social and cultural forces encouraged a new kind of "science" during the SR? To what extent was this "new" inquiry into nature a real break from the past? How and why have historians constructed and revised narratives about the SR? With a thematic rather than chronological approach, we'll trace how ways of thinking, methods of investigation, disciplinary boundaries, roles of institutions, social structures of knowledge production, and the relationship between science and religion did and did not change during the SR. We'll also consider how and why scholarship in the last 30 years has considerably altered both the standard story of the SR and the traditional views of the iconic figures like Copernicus, Galileo, and Newton.

### Course Goals
*   to introduce early modern science and natural philosophy during the SR
*   to consider the social and cultural forces at work on early modern science
*   to summarize the historiographical arguments about whether or not these events comprise a revolution
*   to apply considerations of the SR to the modern scientific enterprise

### Course Expectations
*   Thorough preparedness and engaged participation in every seminar
*   Routine and high-quality contributions to the course blog (~650 words per week, minus a few weeks)
*   2 ~900-word critical reviews from optional readings (articles) on syllabus; short presentation of them in class (these serve as your blog post for that day)
*   2 ~1200-word Wikipedia articles (new or heavily revised entries [can be spread over 3-4 articles, too]) on some topic of your choosing related to the SR (people, events, concepts, etc)

### Grading
Ultimately, you'll be graded on your ability (as far as i can perceive it) to absorb, process, connect, and show facility with course material. This happens through our discussions and the various writing assignments. If you have a question about your performance/grade during the semester, please ask me about it, and I will be very happy to meet with you to discuss how things are going. I understand that everyone comes into the course with different skills and backgrounds and I grade accordingly. In general, if you make a serious effort, then you will do well grade-wise.

*   Intelligent participation (20%)
*   Blog posts (20%)
*   Book reviews and presentations (20%)
*   Longer topic essays (20%)
*   Final project (20%)
