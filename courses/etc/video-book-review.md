# Video Book Review

**This assignment is to force you to think creatively about using new media for scholarly communication.**

The book review is of course one of the most fundamental components of academic, if not literary, discourse. Because there are far more books than anyone can read in their general field, the summaries and commentaries of new works that reviews provide remain an essential guides to scholars at all levels. However, given the increasing space constraints of printed journals, reviews can seem like an exercise in futility.

Fortunately, we are no longer limited to the physically printed word to share ideas about scholarship. Yet writing, especially long-form writing, dominates training in history at all levels. This assignment provides an opportunity to explore the process of creating a short video book review to gain an experiential understanding of its virtues and drawbacks. 

*At a minimum, you will come away with invaluable experience in planning and executing a small video project, a greater appreciation for well-done videos, and ways of thinking about communication that will improve both your writing and presentation skills.*


### So what is a video book review?

Ultimately, it serves the same function as a written book review, and that should be kept in mind at all times. It provides a brief synopsis of the content, highlights key strengths and weaknesses, situates the book in its field, and calls attention to its scholarly contribution and utility. 

While the fundamental goals remain the same, **communicating with a video is a fundamentally different task than communicating by writing**. Conceptualize the video and the narration at the same time. You want a synergy between them, not merely for them to happen at the same time.

Think about video clips and documentaries that have helped you understand something, and what techniques worked. If you can't think of any, find some. Copy them to get started, and find your own style along the way.


*Here are some ideas of things you can do in the video that it would be hard to do with text alone:*

- In summarizing the book, you might show portraits or display other information about a person, place or event that helps bring your summary to life and establish a visual context.

- Show an image of a part of the book, like the table of contents, while describing its organization in general terms.

- Show an image of a part of the book, like the table of contents, while annotating the image to highlight your point.

- Show book jackets of other relevant books that viewers might recognize as you describe its relationship to them.

- Show book jackets of other relevant books that viewers might not recognize to make a point about attention to the topic.

- Use simple text slides or hand-drawn diagrams to illustrate some of your main points about the book. The text can highlight the main points while your narration can add more detail. At the same time, you can also show images (without comment) to add more depth to the viewing experience.

## Software?

You can make a perfectly fine video with free software, which you probably already have. If you're unfamiliar with movie editing software, consider Movie Maker (Windows) or iMovie (Mac), or a free trial (but be careful of the expiration date unless you intend to buy it) of [Camtasia](http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html).

For more details on using Powerpoint/Keynote with Camtasia, see my description of [creating a simple slideshow voice-over](../../tutorials/slideshow-voice-over.html). 

You should upload your video to YouTube or Vimeo, and make sure they are publically viewable. You can take them down when the class is over if you'd like.


## THINGS TO DO
- Start early and get acquainted with the software.

- Think creatively about how to use images, video effects, and your script **in conjunction with each other**.

- Think abstractly and associatively, not just textually.

- Remember that you can do several things on the screen at once, in addition to your narration.

- Get used to hearing your own voice and working to improve your vocal performance. This is really hard, but I think you'll find it enlightening in the end. 

- EXPERIMENT! The only thing you have to fear is boredom. Play with your pacing, use of imagery, use of screen space, etc. Sometimes doing something absurd, just for fun, helps you discover something cool and useful.

- Leave LOTS of time for revisions. Most students, after they figure out what they want to do and make a good draft, want to redo their video with their new knowledge and experience. It actually doesn’t take that long once you know what you’re doing, but most students leave no time for it and are disappointed that they couldn’t fully show off what they learned.


## THINGS NOT TO DO
- Wait until the last minute to start learning video editing software and producing your video.

- Write out a nice book review and then film yourself reading it.

- Create a video that is merely a series of images with you reading a book review as the soundtrack. 

- Underestimate how long it takes to create a quality voice track. A common rookie mistake is to focus mostly on the video, with the audio as an afterthought. Usually, students find that creating good audio takes much longer than the video. 

- Fear your own voice. It's weird to hear your voice coming from outside your head, and in doing so we're forced to confront weird speech habits that we aren't even aware of. Some students thus avoid the audio component of their video as long as possible, but this challenge is integral to the assignment.  

- Get carried away with special effects (video or audio) so that they become gimmicky and distract from the intellectual work of the video. Have fun experimenting, but a little restraint goes a long way.



## Your Grade
These videos produce some grade anxiety because they are foreign, and it’s hard to know if you’re “doing it right.” Seriously, most of your grade is based on you  making a serious effort. As we critique each other’s video drafts in class, you’ll see that it is totally obvious who is putting in work and who isn’t. You are not graded on how polished your video is, but your effort to communicate with the unique capabilities of video.

#### Sample grade guidelines:

There are really two components to your grade, the intellectual work of the book review (the content) and the video (the presentation).

#### Book Review:

C: Mostly focuses on only 1 or 2 core components, for instance providing mostly a summary of the book without any analysis of its strengths or weaknesses or its historiographical context.

B: Touches on most of the core components of a book review, but seems rather superficial in its analysis.

A: Addresses all of the core components in a sophisticated way, drawing widely from course content and materials. 


#### Video:

C: Very few visual effects; video is basically you reading a book review while a few images slide across the screen. Video editing is rather choppy and distracting.

B: Video uses images in provocative ways and incorporates at least a few different techniques; useful juxtaposition for images and narration. 

A: Variety of visual effects (even if they don’t all work perfectly well); interesting interplay between visual and audio tracks; mostly seamless editing.
