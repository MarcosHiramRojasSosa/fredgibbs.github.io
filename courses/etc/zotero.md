#How to Access the Course Zotero Library

Zotero is a free tool for managing bibliographies. If any of your work invovles gathering and organizing sources (books, articles, etc), it is a tool you should consider using. It also helps a group of people share resources, like PDFs. That's how we'll use it.

There are two ways of getting course readings throug the course Zotero Library.

1. Use the Zotero.org website to access the materials online as you need them.
2. Install the software on your computer, which will download all the readings for you.

##Create an account at zotero.org
You will get an email inviting you to join a Zotero group library. If you click on the link in the email to join the library, you will be asked to register at [zotero.org](http://zotero.org) (or you can [preemptively](https://www.zotero.org/user/register) do so ahead of time). Creating a Zotero account is free, and requires only that you specify a username, password, and email address. **You must register at zotero.org regardless of which method you use to access the course readings.**

##Accept my invitation to join the group library for the course
Once you’ve created a Zotero account, you'll be able to officially join the group library for the course. 

##View the course library online
Once you've created and account AND accepted the invitation to join the group, you'll be able to visit the [course library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/242299/items). You'll see all of the readings listed there, and you can download the PDFs as need be. 

##If installing Zotero on your computer
Using the Zotero website to access the readings is a bit clunky. If you download and install Zotero on your computer, you'll have a much better interface to the readings and you'll always have them at the ready. Once you've installed Zotero, you'll have the option to link your installation of Zotero to your zotero.org account. Do this. Then, automagically, you should see a collection titled “medieval-science-medicine” under the “Group Libraries” header in the the leftmost column of your Zotero display. It will take a few minutes to download all the readings, but then you'll have a copy of the course library with all of the readings available to you, even when you're offline.

##Unsolicited advice
I recommend that you install and use the Zotero software on your computer rather than just downloading the readings from the the course library page. For the purposes of this course, it doesn't matter which method you use. But learning how to stay organized in your studies is a crucial skill that you'll want to develop sooner than later because it will save you tremendous amounts of time. This course is a great excuse to start getting digitally organized. Your future self will thank you.
