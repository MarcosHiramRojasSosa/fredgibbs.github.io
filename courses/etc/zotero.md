#How to Access the Course Zotero Library

[Zotero](http://zotero.org) is a free tool for managing bibliographies. If any of your work invovles gathering and organizing sources (books, articles, or any other form), you should consider using it. It also helps a group of people share not only bibliographies, but also resources like PDFs. That's how we'll use it.

There are two ways of getting course readings throug the course Zotero Library.

1. Use the Zotero.org website to access the materials online as you need them.
2. Install the software on your computer, which will download all the readings for you and allow you to access and read them offline (and take notes, etc).

There are a few prelimnary that everyone must do regardless of how you intend to access the readings:

# Step 1: Create an account at zotero.org
Regardless of which method you use, you must [sign up for a free account at zotero.org](https://www.zotero.org/user/register). Creating a Zotero account requires only that you specify a username, password, and email address. You will not get any spam from them or anyone else because of your Zotero account. **You must register at zotero.org regardless of which method you use to access the course readings.**

# Step 2: Accept the invitation to join the group library for the course
Keep an eye out for an email from Zotero.org that will invite you to join the group library. **You need to click the link in the invitation email to join the group!** If Even once you have already created a Zotero account, if you try to view the group library before you have accepted the invitation you will get an "Access Denied" error.

# Step 3: View the course library online
Once you've created and account AND accepted the invitation to join the group, you'll be able to visit the course library (the link is specified on the course syllabus). If you have created your account, accepted the invitation to join the library, and signed into Zotero, you'll see all of the readings listed there, and you can download the PDFs as need be. IF you'd like, you don't need to do anything else.

# Optional Step 4: Installing Zotero on your computer
Using the Zotero website to access the readings is a bit clunky. If you [download and install Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/download/) on your computer, you'll have a much better interface to the readings. I recommend using the "Standalone" version.

Once you've installed Zotero on your computer, you'll have the option to link your installation of Zotero to your zotero.org account. Do this. Then, automagically, you should see a collection titled similarly to the course under the “Group Libraries” header in the the leftmost column of your Zotero display. It will take a few minutes to download all the readings, but then you'll have a copy of the course library with all of the readings available to you, even when you're offline.

# Unsolicited advice
I recommend that you install and use the Zotero (the Standalone version) on your computer rather than just downloading the readings from the the course library page. For the purposes of this course, it doesn't matter which method you use. But learning how to stay organized in your studies is a crucial skill that you'll want to develop sooner than later because it will save you tremendous amounts of time. This course is a great excuse to start getting digitally organized. Your future self will thank you.
