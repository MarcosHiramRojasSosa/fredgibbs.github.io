# Critique Writing Guide

# Your Assignment
Your challenge is to write a 400-word review/critique of some “publication” pertaining to this course---namely the relationship between food, health, and diet. It can be an article or blog post from a website, newspaper, or magazine; it can be a video, movie, or food documentary; science research article, historical scholarship, or whatever you like. Feel free to find these via Google, UNM Library databases, or whatever (you’ll have more fun with Google). 

Don't choose something that is super long or complex; that creates way more work for you than is necessary here. Also, don't choose anything that is super short and trite; it simply won't give you enough material to work with. 


# Assignment Goals
This assignment shows that you’re able to apply the course discussion and activities in the real world by critically analyzing some source that you might read even outside of this course. **This is the goal of the entire course---see the learning objectives on the syllabus!---to help you think carefully and historically about diet and health.**


# Some organizational advice
You should begin your essay with a **quick summary** of the source---no more than a few sentences---so that your readers have an idea of what the point is (assume they have not read it themselves).

Then, comment about the evidence used to make the point. Maybe there are "scientific" studies, maybe anecdotal evidence, maybe nothing. Relatedly, how does the author establish expertise or authority?

Are you convinced by the evidence? What is problematic or missing? What are the assumptions of the author about the nature of diet and health?

**Can history of diet and health (as we've discussed it so far), provide any insight into what the article is talking about?** For instance, you might discuss (thinking about the early part of the course in particular) _how your source balances common sense and medical advice_.

The 400 word format is very deliberate, to force you to think about quality over quantity. The challenge isn't to write 400 words, but pack as much analysis into 400 words as you can. It's a super useful skill that you'll frequently employ in your future career, whatever it is.
 

# References and Citations
You should cite passages from the readings with author-date notation. 

An example: _Although Cheyne appealed to his personal experience with diet, he himself was extraordinarily large (Shapin, "Trusting," 276)._ Note that I've used a abbreviated form of the article name since we read two things by Shapin. You can omit that if there is only one source by the author, like (Cowan, 15). 

If you cite something from outside the class, you need to provide a foot- or endnote with a full reference to that source (either a URL or regular bibliographic citation). You can use any format you want, but be consistent.


# Formatting checklist
- 12 pt. Times New Roman (or very similar serif font)
- Double spaced (except name and source reference)
- 1" margins on all sides

## Include at the top of your essay
- Your name
- A link or bibliographic reference to your source


# Tips for success
 - **Be specific.** This is probably the biggest weakness with most essays. Don't say "This advice is like what Galen said." Give more details about how (and how much) such a claim is true, cite relevant passages from Galen (and/or readings about him), and why your comparison matters.
 - **Provide specific citations.** This forces you to double check your own memory of the readings and helps you avoid making false claims.
 - **Don't be banal.** Avoid trivial statements that are simply fluff and don't show you engaging with the course materials or your source.
 - **Paraphase.** Avoid long quotations in your critique, since you want use those 400 words for yourself!
 - **Be selective.** You can’t fit everything worth saying into 400 words. Choose carefully what you think is most important! 
 - **Revise, revise, revise.** Once you have a complete draft of everything you want to say, you are about 50% done. Set it aside (and budget time for this!), then come back and economize your prose. Remove simple sentences that force you to be unnecessarily verbose.

 In the process of getting your ideas down, you might end up with something like: "This article does not cite any research. The lack of research means it is difficult to understand if it should be trusted." (22 words)

 During revisions, you should rephrase this to: "The article's lack of research compromises its authority." (8 words) This gives you much-needed space for more analysis!

**Note: Revisions are hard!** But they are the only way to make your writing shine.


# Resubmissions
If you are not pleased with your grade, you can revise and resubmit them within **2 weeks** of getting them back. You get an average grade between the two, though I tend to count the second one a bit more. I encourage you to meet with me about your essay before revising it to make sure you have a clear plan for revisions.
