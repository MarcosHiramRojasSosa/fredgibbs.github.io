### Course Description
This course provides synthetic and interpretive frameworks for understanding the evolution of western medicine. It chronologically explores the wide range of theories and practices employed by physicians, including various approaches to understanding and treating diseases and the rise and development of the medical profession. The course demonstrates how, in addition to medical knowledge, shifting social and cultural values have motivated change in medicine; it also shows how a historical awareness of medicine gives us new and crucial perspectives on contemporary medical practices. The emphasis shall always remain on showing how and why medical theory and practice looked like it did rather than simply regurgitating what happened over time.


### Course Goals
- Get a sense of the overall trajectory of the history of medicine.

- Understand how medicine is influenced by shifting cultural, social, and political attitudes. 

- Appreciate how the history of medicine can be told from multiple perspectives, each of which has its own agenda.


### Course Expectations and Grading
- Thorough preparedness and engaged participation in every class meeting. See the note about readings and discussion below. (40%)

- Original 400-word critical "reading reactions" posted to the course blog on your assigned posting days. I will supply a brief prompt for these to help focus your posts on key issues. These should NOT merely summarize the readings, but critically evaluate them and ask questions that will guide our discussion. (30%)

- One topic introduction, which means getting up in front of the class and recapitulating the assigned reading and asking interesting questions (~10 mins.) (10%)

- Completion of a Final Project (see below) related to the history of early medicine. (20%)


### Final Project
You need to propose and complete a final project that shows that you've learned something. This entails two steps: 1) Proposing a question to answer or topic to research; 2) Actually doing it. You can't get to step #2 without successfully completing step #1, which will happen via the course blog. You can get ideas from or actually do one of the samples, but your project will be much better if you tackle something you're at least vaguely interested in.

#### Sample Questions/Topics
- To what extent is ancient and medieval medicine wrong (compared to modern views) simply because they had inferior medical technology?

- Compare and contrast ancient, medieval, and early modern views on [anatomy, surgery, pharmacy, etc].

- How has medical theory and practice been affected by social factors outside of "pure" medical knowledge?

- What, if anything, can modern medicine learn from pre-modern medicine?


### Other Advice to Help You Do Well
-   Do not suffer in silence. I try to situate discussions and assignments squarely within the objectives of the course, but I expect that you'll ask for clarification if such connections elude you.

-   If you have questions about your performance / grade during the semester, I will be very happy to meet with you to discuss how things are going. I understand that everyone comes into the course with different skills and backgrounds. **Serious effort goes a long way toward your grade!**
