This course chronologically explores the wide range of theories and practices employed by pre-modern physicians and healers. It emphasizes their various approaches to understanding and treating disease and the gradual development of the medical profession. Although medieval and early modern medicine can seem utterly irrelevant to today's world, this course illustrates how a historical awareness of medicine gives us important perspectives on contemporary medical practices. Even more broadly, the course provide synthetic and interpretive frameworks for understanding the evolution of western medicine over time, such as how shifting social and cultural values have motivated (and continue to motivate) change in medicine. The emphasis shall always remain on showing how and why medical theory and practice looked like it did rather than simply regurgitating what happened over time.


h2. Student Learning Outcomes

* Understand the overall chronological and thematic trajectory of pre-modern medicine, approaching it from multiple points of view (theory, practice, disease, doctors, patients, etc.).

* Discuss and write critically about how medicine and medical values are influenced by shifting cultural, social, religious, and political attitudes. 

* Reflect on and evaluating contemporary medical culture using the historical perspectives and analytical frameworks provided by the course.

* Critically evaluate contemporary medical writing (newspaper and magazine articles) to explicate the assumptions and values baked into modern medical thinking and its discourse.


h2. Course Expectations and Grading

* 50% of your grade is from class participation; 50% is from written work.

* Participation component is based on preparedness for and engagement with the class discussion. You do not have to talk all the time to do well. You need to ask good questions, give good answers to questions, and generally *be active*. Aim for quality over quantity. If you talk a lot, you're probably just diluting your good ideas. If you don't talk at all, you will seriously compromise your grade. (45%)

* You will also give one topic introduction, which means getting up in front of the class, summarizing the assigned reading and asking interesting questions about the text and how it fits into the course (~10 mins.) and generally being our discussion leader. (5%)

* There are 3 written assignments (due dates are indicated on the reading schedule below): 2 article reviews and 1 final essay. The first and second assignments will be 750 words and the final 1000. These are worth 10%, 15%, and 20% of your grade, respectively. 

* The article reviews are a critical analysis of an article from a respectable newspaper or magazine or website about medicine (past or present). The choice of article is yours. *The goal is not simply to meet the word count, but to critically analyze the article you choose and relate it to the course.* You might explain how something billed as "new" has much earlier precedents. You might explain why a modern approach to a disease or medical issue differs from earlier medical responses. Even though you can choose your article to review, don't pick something that you can't relate to the course. Ask if you are unsure about whether an article is suitable or not. 

* Both reviews and the final essay can be submitted ahead of the due date via for preview, and I will provide brief comments as to whether you are on the right track or any major changes you should consider making.

* If you are displeased with your grade and think you can do better, you can visit with me about your paper, rework it, resubmit it, and I'll regrade it. You'll get the average of the two grades. There is no guarantee your grade will improve, but it always does.

* Your final will be to answer one of the questions listed below. I am open to alternative questions or creative projects, too, if you'd like to suggest one.


h3. Sample Questions/Topics

* To what extent is ancient and medieval medicine wrong (compared to modern views) because they had inferior medical technology?

* Compare and contrast ancient, medieval, and early modern medical frameworks.

* How has medical theory and practice been affected by social factors outside of "pure" medical knowledge?

* What, if anything, can modern medicine learn from pre-modern medicine?



h2. Other Advice to Help You Do Well

*   Do not suffer in silence. I try to situate discussions and assignments squarely within the objectives of the course, but I expect that you'll ask for clarification if such connections elude you.

*   If you have questions about your performance / grade during the semester, I will be very happy to meet with you to discuss how things are going. I understand that everyone comes into the course with different skills and backgrounds. **Serious effort goes a long way toward your grade!** 



h2. READINGS

*   Andrew Wear et al., _The Western Medical Tradition_ (Cambridge University Press, 1995) ISBN:978-0521475648 ["amazon":http://www.amazon.com/books/dp/0521475643)]

Most reading assignments are listed as pages from _WMT_, which will serve as our primary guide through the course. Reading assignments often include some short excerpts from historical sources themselves to give us a better feel for how people talked about medicine at a given time. These excerpts will be available at "UNM e-reserves":http://ereserves.unm.edu/eres/coursepage.aspx?cid=12559&page=docs.
