## Course Description
This interdisciplinary course explores the effects of the digital age on producing and consuming history. Combining general readings with introductory exercises to develop core digital history skills, some questions that we will take up include: How are historians adapting research and publication practices to use digitized archives and historical data? How will historians access, visualize, and analyze the massive born digital historical record? How does the Web change the kinds and forms of history that should be produced? How does the Web (and resources like Wikipedia) change general perceptions or uses of history? How does historical thinking improve information literacy?

The course draws from contemporary readings in history, public history, historiography, digital humanities, literary studies, media studies, and library and museum studies. Along with our readings, we will investigate a variety of digital history (and archive) projects that feature various digital methods (such as topic modeling, mapping, data visualization, and so on). We’ll critique all aspects (data, design, interface, utility, etc.) of these projects to understand the technologies and data involved. Based on this work, we’ll collaboratively design and publish a scholarly website that showcases our rigorous reviews of these digital projects.

## Student Learning Outcomes
- Understand current debates and speak intelligently with both skeptics and advocates about the history and future of digital scholarship and its relationship to the humanities.

- Appreciate the theoretical possibilities and practical limitations of digital archives and new research methodologies.

- Begin to experiment with new tools, workflows, methods, and techniques for large-scale research questions in history.

- Think critically about how history is produced, disseminated, and consumed in the digital age.


## Work Requirements and Grading
- Thorough preparedness and engaged participation in every class meeting (50%)

- Serious effort and on-time completion of the many class assignments. Some of these are critical website or project reviews, others are slightly more technical challenges (no prior experience required), others are design challenges. We also do considerable peer review in the class, and you are graded on those efforts as well. (50%)

While I try to provide feedback throughout the semester, you are heartily encourage to speak with me at any time to learn what I think of your performance in the class and how it can be improved.
