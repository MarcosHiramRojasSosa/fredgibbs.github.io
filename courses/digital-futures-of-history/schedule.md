# IN PROGRESS!
This syllabus is a living document and changes frequently, depending on what's going on in the course, though the general workload will remain more or less as indicated. If you print it out, you'll need to keep your paper version up to date with the online version.

### How do they read?
One of our goals is to think critically about how digital interfaces to historical interpretation changes the way we think about the past. This also includes examining the forms of the readings, particularly how the different layouts, typography, and writing style affects the way we interact with them. Please come to class prepared to discuss both form _and_ content.


## 1: Course Introduction

### Wednesday
Today we'll review the syllabus, course aims, assignments, and general plan for the semester. We'll also figure out how to customize the course to best suit participants' interests. 


## 2: Ethos of Digital History / Humanities

### Monday
William Cronon, [The Public Practice of History in and for a Digital Age](http://www.historians.org/perspectives/issues/2012/1201/The-Public-Practice-of-History-in-and-for-a-Digital-Age.cfm).

Lisa Spiro, ["This Is Why We Fight": Defining the Values of the Digital Humanities](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/debates/text/13).

### Wednesday
Stephen Ramsay, [DH Types One and Two](http://stephenramsay.us/2013/05/03/dh-one-and-two/).

Mark Sample, [The Digital Humanities Is Not About Building, It’s About Sharing](http://www.samplereality.com/2011/05/25/the-digital-humanities-is-not-about-building-its-about-sharing/).

Peruse and come prepared to discuss some the sites listed [here](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_vault/2016/12/30/five_great_digital_history_projects_from_2016.html) (and also briefly survey some of the past projects (links near the top) to get a historical perspective), and [here](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_vault/2017/01/05/some_of_the_most_browsable_history_sites_we_encountered_in_2016.html). 

You don't need to spend a lot of time on each site, but you should be familiar with their purpose and functionality, as well as what you think they do well and not so well. 

In following up the possibility of doing a Diag history, it seems oddly difficult to find much. The [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diag), the first search result, largely ignores its history; a tantalizingly named but not all that helpful [history](https://heritage.umich.edu/stories/a-different-diag/), might be a model for something we make. This could be a demanding but fun project that would give us hands-on experience with many (not overly technical) digital skills, and be of wide interest to the community.

Be sure to click through this [UM History site](http://umhistory.org/history/index.html), and think about how we might contribute to or improve on that effort. I didn't find much on the diag in this, either.
