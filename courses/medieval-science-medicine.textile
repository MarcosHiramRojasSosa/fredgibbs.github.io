h2. Overview

<div id="accordion">

h3. Course Description

<div>
<p>
	This course explores the nature of science and medicine in Western Europe roughly spanning 400–1400. After a brief introduction to the crucial contributions in natural philosophy and medicine from the classical world, we'll examine how various social, cultural, and institutional structures influenced medieval understandings of the world. In terms of specific topics, we'll look at cosmology, astronomy, astrology, alchemy, chemistry, natural history, physics, and philosophy. We'll also investigate broader themes, such as the theoretical and practical sides of medieval medicine, the contributions of Islamic culture to Western science, interactions between science and religion (especially natural philosophy and theology), and the university's rise and influence on the Western intellectual tradition. While surveying the context of medieval frameworks for investigating and explaining the natural world, we'll also reflect on the nature and utility of the term "science," the extent to which the origins of modern science can be located in the Middle Ages, and the importance of putting the modern scientific enterprise in historical perspective.
</p>
</div>

h3. Student Learning Outcomes

<div>
<p>

* Appreciate important developments in medieval science and medicine, especially how they can and should be understood from multiple points of view.
* Discuss and write critically about how the nature and practices of science are influenced by shifting cultural, social, religious, and political attitudes.
* Critically evaluate "popular" writings about medieval science and medicine from the web against more "scholarly" interpretations and reflect on the differences between them.

</p>
</div>

h3. Work Requirements and Grading

<div>
<p>
* Everyone starts with a C in the course. I assume you are all average students who do average quality work. I know this is false, but it's my starting point. 
* You raise (or lower) your grade based on the quality of your participation in class and your submitted written work.
* Simply showing up to class doesn't count for anything; **I expect that you'll attend most classes and be an active participant in most discussions**. Given the class size, this means that you'll have a few comments or questions to contribute at least every other meeting. If you do this, you'll raise your grade one letter grade (ie C->B).
* 3 750-word review articles of websites about the Middle Ages.
* 1 1000-word Wikipedia entry on a topic of your choice.
* If your essays follow the protocols (listed below), you'll raise your grade one letter grade (ie B->A).
* If you are displeased with your grade for any assignemnt, you can visit with me about your paper, rework it, and resubmit it. You can continue to do this until we agree that your essay isn't going to improve anymore. Your final grade will reflect both your mastery of course material and your effort to improve your essay. *You cannot resubmit work without first meeting with me about your original submission and its flaws.*

</p>
</div>

h3. Assignment Protocols

<div>
<p>
* The website reviews are a critical analysis of a website or an online article about or related to medieval science or medicine. You choose what to review by Googling something you're interested in. *The goal is to critically analyze your source and relate it to the course. Meeting the word count counts for nothing.* Even though you can choose your article to review, don't pick something that we haven't discussed yet. Please ask if you are unsure about whether an article is suitable or not.

* Your essays should be written for someone interested in but ignorant about the Middle Ages. You should (1) have a specific point that you want to make; (2) tell the reader clearly what it is; (3) use specific examples from the course readings to support your argument.

* Provide a brief but informative and relevant summary of the website article you're looking at. Assume readers of your essay are thinking about reading the same thing and they are looking to you for guidance.

* Questions you should address in your essay: How does the article portray medieval science or medicine in general? Does it offer a fair assessment or characterization? Are its claims supported by historical evidence? What are its sources? Is the article trustworthy? Does it make an interesting and worthwhile point?

* On the above matters, provide constructive criticism with **specific examples and evidence**. It is not sufficient to say something is "good" or "useful" or "trustworthy" or "bad" or "wrong". You must also show **WHY** your characterizations should be taken seriously. 

* Establish your authority to critically evaluate the website, which now have since you're in this course. You can do this by directly and specifically engaging with BOTH the COURSE and the WEBSITE. Every sentence with a vague generalization without supporting evidence undermines your credibility, and, frankly, annoys me.

* As part of asserting your bona fides, write with charmisa, style, and wit. Bad reviews read like book reports. Nobody likes to read book reports.

* Your Wikipedia article, which serves as your final exam, will be written in stages over the last quarter of the course. You are not writing a potential article, but a very real one that will be published for all the world to read. Ample guidance about this process will be provided as the end of the semester nears.

* **Final articles must be posted online by 9:30am on May 14.**

</p>
</div>


h3. Keys to Success 

<div>
<p>
* The reading load for the course is relatively heavy, usually about 20-30 pages per meeting. Do not get bogged down in details; read for the main point of the article and get a sense of the evidence that the author uses to make the point. The readings will challenge you, but will greatly reward you for putting in the time and effort. **Your thinking and writing will improve noticeably by the end of the semester.**

* This is **not** a lecture class; I expect that you'll come ready to discuss the assigned reading. It is common to be shy about speaking in front of your peers, to find it difficult to listen and think on the fly, and to worry about sounding stupid. These are all perfectly natural concerns, but they can be overcome only with practice. I can't think of any successful people who are afraid to join a conversation.

* Participation is not limited to answering my questions; it also means offering alternative viewpoints, interpretations, and asking questions about readings and the ongoing discussion. If you come to class with some questions, you'll always have an easy way to get involved.

* **This course emphasizes historical thinking and analysis over regurgitating information.** This means that your review essays should draw heavily from the themes of our discussions. You cannot write good essays from the reading assignments alone, nor can you write good essays without referencing relevant passages in the readings. Both of these should be easy if you're putting in a sustained effort throughout the course. If you try to write an essay at the last minute, you will fail, and will have to redo the assignment.

* **Do not suffer in silence.** I try to situate discussions and assignments squarely within the objectives of the course, but I expect that you'll ask for clarification if such connections elude you.

* If you have questions about your performance / grade during the semester, I will be very happy to meet with you to discuss how things are going. If, therefore, you feel uncertainty about your grade, it's your own fault. 

* Please note that I understand that everyone comes into the course with different backgrounds, skills, and experience. **Serious effort goes a long way toward your grade!**
