## Course Description

What constitutes healthy food? A healthy diet? A healthy body? Needless to say, dietary regimens to restore or maintain health--as well as what it means to be healthy--have remained preeminent questions throughout Western medical history. Yet even today, medical understandings of diet and official dietary advice seems to change almost daily. This course explores how various cultural, scientific, and medical values have continually shaped our relationship to food, health, and diet from the "discovery" of America to the present.

Some guiding questions: How and why have the perceived medical virtues of various foods changed over time? Why have fad diets come in and gone out of fashion? How has modern medicine continually redefined what it means to be healthy and to eat a healthy diet? How have national recommendations for healthy foods been used as social controls? How have changing attitudes about the body, health, and technology shaped our preferences for what should be considered healthy food?

The course will be taught in the shiny new Teaching and Learning building in "learning studios" that look like [this](https://www.unm.edu/~oset/Event%20Descriptions/LearningStudioClassroomsatUNM.html). Discussions will be more like labs, in which everyone will be working in small groups to research and discuss and present on relevant topics and research exercises. One of these topics will be the nature and history of local food, in parallel with October as "Local Food Month" in ABQ.

## Student Learning Outcomes

* Understand the changing notion of diet and the constantly shifting relationship between diet and health in Western medicine.

* Appreciate how attitudes about diet are not based on "objective" medical knowledge, but grow out of complex constellation of social, political, and cultural values.

* Develop sensitivity to how different social and cultural populations approach food and health in vastly different terms, and how this might inform food, diet, and health policy decisions.

* Sharpen critical thinking skills by evaluating online dietary advice while exposing its assumptions and putting it in historical perspective.


## Work Requirements and Grading

* Everyone starts with a C in the course. I assume you are all average students who do average quality work. I know this is false, but it's my starting point. It's your job to prove me wrong via your engagement in the course.

* You raise (or lower) your grade based on the quality of your participation in class discussions and activities, random assignments, and (least frequently) your submitted written work.

* The class will meet in the shiny new Teaching and Learning building in "[learning studios](https://www.unm.edu/~oset/Event%20Descriptions/LearningStudioClassroomsatUNM.html)." Discussions will be more like labs where everyone will be working in groups to research the weekly topic and making extensive use of the video projector and whiteboards to share and communicate. Part of most class meetings will be dedicated to group project work; every Friday we will have group presentations that will summarize and bring together the readings for the week in a visual way.

* Simply showing up to class counts for very little; **I expect that you'll attend most classes and actively participate in all activities. This work counts for 50% of your grade.** If you want a course where you can sit back and occasionally regurgitate information, this course isn't for you.

* 4 750-word historical analyses of a recent "publication" pertaining to food, health, and diet. These can be from a newspaper, magazine, movie, science research article, historical scholarship, or whatever you like. They should be easily accessible through Google (this is not a scholarly or library research assignment, though you can go that route if you want). The goal is to find something you might read even if you weren't in the course, and critique it from a historical perspective that you're hopefully getting in the course. These assignments will show that you're able to apply the course discussion and activities in productive ways. (30%)

* Your final "exam" will consist of contributing to a group project that examines some facet of the relationship between food, health and diet. All groups will present during the last week of class. You will compose and be individually graded on a 750-word essay that explains what you learned in the course and how you applied that to the project. (20%)

* If you are displeased with your grade for any assignment, you can visit with me about your paper, rework it, and resubmit it *within 1 week*. You can continue to do this until we agree that it isn't going to improve anymore. Your final grade will reflect both your mastery of course material and your effort to improve your essay. *You cannot resubmit work without first meeting with me in my office to discuss the merits and flaws of your original submission.*
