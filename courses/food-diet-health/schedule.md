### Introductions
22: Introduction to the course, syllabus, and expectations.

24: **Selections from _Galen on Food and Diet_: 1-8; 14-18; 68-84.** How did physicians like Galen conceive the notion of disease? According to Galen, how does diet fit into medical understandings of disease? How is his approach similar and different to modern approaches to diet? How would you describe his writing style? Does it seem strange for a physician? 

26: **Brian Cowan, "New Worlds and New Tastes," 1-17.** This reading covers both foodways (kinds of foods, manners, etc.) as well as dietary concerns; feel free to skim the non-health bits as you come across them. They are interesting, but not our primary focus. Still, we should ask: why does **cuisine** get so much attention (particularly pp. 11-17)? In terms of diet and health, what's different in the 1500s? Galen talked a little about the difference between food and drug (and we will talk more about that during class)--what's the difference between food and drug in the Renaissance? Why is there no discussion of the unhealthiness of sugar?


### Enlightened Diets
**Reading Note:** The below readings (through the 2nd) are updated from the original syllabus. For the mobidly curious, you can see what you missed in the Zotero library with J. Worth Estes, "The Medical Properties of Food." Sorry for the late change, but it's worth it! All new readings are in our Zotero library.

29: **Ken Albala, "The Human Body," 48-62; "Food," 82-88; 91-104.** The PDF has considerably more than you need to read. For the specified page ranges, only read within entire sections. For instance: on page 62, read only up through the "Spirits" heading, and so on; some sections (like on p. 91) start near the bottom of the page [ = less reading!]. 

*Reading Guide:* Where do you see overlap with Galen's ideas? What do you see as the pros and cons for the Renaissance understanding of digestion? Why do drunk people crave salty foods? Why does the physicality of food matter so much if balancing the humours is so important? Aren't they totally different systems? Is there a modern analog to the Renaissance "virtues" of certain foods as described in the reading?

31: **Steven Shapin, "How to Eat like a Gentleman," 21-48.**

*Reading Guide:* How are the _kinds_ of sources examined in this reading different from what we've considered so far? How does the dietary advice differ? To what extent were plain and simple meals a dietary as opposed to a social concern? What did nationality have to do with dietary choices? How does grandmotherly expertise conflict with medical expertise? What did it mean to "live physically"? Why would anyone (not) want to? How does this idea connect with the Cowan reading from last Friday? "_Is it so great a thing to be alive?_ " How did the fact that the target audience was "gentlemen" matter to the reception of the advice? Do you see any vestiges of English gentlemanly dietary advice in modern American dietary advice? What do you consider the most important point(s) from the last section (much of which we will return to in various ways throughout the semester)? 


2: **George Cheyne, _An Essay on Regimen_," i-xxiv.** Here's our first excursion into a primary source without translation (making its eccentricities even more apparent). The language seems weird at first (and it is, compared to ours) but you get used to it after a few pages. How does Cheyne's advice echo what we've been reading about? What is different? In either case, what are his primary concerns? To what extent do you see the moral component of diet that we began to talk about last time? Can anyone actually follow this kind of advice?


### Dietary Expertise
5: NO CLASS (labor day); spend time finding something to critique for your first essay (due next Monday). Email with questions!  

7: **Steven Shapin, "Trusting George Cheyne," 263-279.**

*Reading Guide:* This reading continues and focuses our previous attention to medical expertise and moral authority. We've already read and summarized (thanks to your hard work last Friday) Cheyne's own medical writing, so please keep that in mind when reading more about Cheyne himself. 

With respect to the "Gentleman" reading (from the same author as this article), I asked _How did the fact that the target audience was "gentlemen" matter to the reception of the advice?)_ This was meant to prime us for thinking about common sense vs. expert advice that we're reading about for today. **Was this a new tension in the 1700s?** **How much do we still have this tension regarding modern dietary concerns?** Part of the answer to this depends on what "common sense" is at a time. What was the typical layperson's medical knowledge in the 1700s? And today? NOTE in particular: _In dietetics ... medicine pitched its tent on ground already densely occupied by moral common sense._  What medical advice is carved on the Apollo's temple at Delphi? How similar and different to modern dietary advice? What were common criticisms of 18th-century physicians? What does Shapin mean by "micromechanism" and "iatromechanical"? Where do these terms come from? 

And the biggest question that links our two discussions this week: **How did Cheyne establish his medical reputation?** Think about how some of the sections from his text we read last week can help us answer this so far.


9: **Shapin, "Trusting George Cheyne," 279-297.**  

*Reading Guide:* What kinds of advice did his patients get in their personal correspondence? To what extent were these reasonable? Was there any conflict with common sense? How different was public and private medical advice? How specifically did Cheyne appeal to morality in his letters with patients? How did his own physical condition matter? How prevelant was the "micromechanical" approach/advice we read about last time? What kinds of experience does Shapin discuss? What are the modern analogs?


### 19th-century Reformers
12: **First Essay Due**. Remember to review the [critique writing guide](http://fredgibbs.net/courses/etc/critique-writing-guide). 

[Sylvester Graham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvester_Graham) and Cindy Lobel, "Sylvester Graham and Antebellum Diet Reform." (recently added to the Zotero library) and [also online, but sometimes restricted](http://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/first-age-reform/essays/sylvester-graham-and-antebellum-diet-reform). Strangely, you can usually access this by Googling for it, and then clicking the link in the search results (but a direct link asks you to log in).

*Reading Guide:* Focus on your essays! The short Lobel essay describes how Graham is an important predecessor to popular contemporary food evangelists (and best-selling authors) like Michael Pollan. How can we use the course so far to better understand Graham himself?

14: **Elisabeth Meyer-Renschhausen and Albert Wirz, "Dietetics, Health Reform and Social Order: Vegetarianism as a Moral Physiology. The Example of Maximilian Bircher-Benner (1867-1939)," *Medical History* 43 (1999): 323-41.**  


*Reading Guide:* 

- Why was there a need for dietetic reform? How is this similar to and different from cultural circumstances we’ve seen before?
- Cheyne talked about pipes and juices. What kinds of metaphors or analogies characterize Bircher-Benner’s dietetics? Why?
- What is “anti-rationalistic” with respect to a diet? Why would a diet be characterized this way? How could one show it wasn’t?
- What kind of arguments were being made against eating meat?
- What’s the big picture point of the Müsli story?


16: **Regina Martkell Morantz, Making Women Modern: Middle Class Women and Health Reform in 19th Century America," *Journal of Social History* 10.4 (1977): 490-507.**

*Reading Guide Challenge:* **Come to class with three questions!** Please try to formulate questions as per previous reading guides--questions that pull out key themes or ideas that help us focus on their significance. Don't get bogged down in details! I know you'll be busy revising your essays, but you should be able to read the entire article quickly (it's short) and still come up with good questions. I will randomly select students to share their questions for our discussion---so be prepared!
