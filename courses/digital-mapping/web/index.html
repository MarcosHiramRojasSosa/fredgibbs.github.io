    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>All associated files (data, javascript, etc) can be viewed by finding and clicking on the file names in the HTML source code.</p>
    <p>Notice that many of these files load maps (or configuration parameters) in a slightly different way to provide a variety of examples of how one can initialize and configure a map. 
    <p>If you don't understand something in any of the code, or you need an example of something else, tweet at me (@fredgibbs) and use the #digmaps hashtag so everyone can follow the thread.</p>
